<head>The Bible; Its Origin, History, and Place in the World</head>

<p>
The Bible contains proof in itself of its divine origin. No
other book can answer the questionings of the mind or satisfy
the longings of the heart as does the Bible. It is adapted to
every age and condition of life, and is full of that knowledge
which enlightens the mind and sanctifies the soul.
</p>

<p>
In the Bible we have a revelation of the living God. Received
by faith, it has power to transform the life. During
all its history a divine watch-care has been over it, and preserved
it for the world.
</p>

<div>
<head>How, When, and Why Written</head>

<p>
After the flood, as men became numerous, and darkness was
again settling over the world, holy men wrote as they were
moved by the Spirit of God. Thus God spoke to His people,
and through them to the world, that a knowledge of God and
of His will might not perish from the earth.
</p>

<p>
For centuries this work went on, until Christ, the promised
Seed, came. With Him, and the blessed message of light and
salvation proclaimed by Him and by His apostles, the Scripture
record closed, and the Word of God was complete.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>Original Writings and Translations</head>

<p>
The Old Testament Scriptures were first written in Hebrew,
upon scrolls, or rolls of parchment, linen, or papyrus. These
were later translated into Greek, the oldest translation being
known as the Septuagint, or <q>Version of the Seventy,</q> made at
Alexandria, for the Alexandrian Library, by a company of
seventy learned Jews, under the patronage of Ptolemy Philadelphus,
<pb n='014'/><anchor id='Pg014'/>
about 285 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi> The original order for this translation
is said to have been given by Alexander the Great, who previously,
upon visiting Jerusalem in 332 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi>, had learned from
the prophecy of Daniel that Grecia was to overthrow the Persian
kingdom. See Josephus's <q>Antiquities of the Jews,</q> book 11,
chap. 8, par. 5. This was the version in common use in the
time of Christ.
</p>

<p>
The New Testament was all originally written in Greek,
except Matthew, which was first written in Hebrew, and later
translated into Greek.

  </figure>
</p>

<p>
At an early date, Latin translations, both of the Septuagint
and of the Greek New Testament, were made by different
individuals, and the more carefully prepared Latin Vulgate of
Jerome, the Bible complete, was made <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> 383-405.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>Printing and the Bible</head>

<p>
Printing, however, being yet unknown, copies of the Bible
could be produced only by the slow, laborious, and expensive
process of handwriting. This necessarily greatly limited its
circulation. Worse still, its illuminating and saving truths
were largely hidden for centuries by the errors, superstitions,
and apostasy of the dark ages. During this time the common
people knew little of its contents.
</p>

<pb n='015'/><anchor id='Pg015'/>

<p>
But with the invention of the art of printing about the middle
of the fifteenth century, and with the dawn of the great Reformation
in the century following, the Bible entered upon a new
era, preparatory to the final proclamation of the gospel throughout
the world.
</p>

    <head>Luther Translating The Bible</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
Not a little significant is the fact that the first book printed
from movable type was the Bible in Latin, which came from the
press of John Gutenberg, at Mentz, Germany, in 1456, a copy
of which, in 1911, was sold in New York City for fifty thousand
dollars, the highest price ever paid for a single book.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>The Bible in Native Tongues</head>

<p>
Thus far, however, the Bible had been published only in
ancient tongues, now little understood by the common people.
Without the Word of God in their hands, the good seed sown
among them was easily destroyed. <q>O,</q> said the advocates
of its pure teachings, <q>if the people only had the Word of God
in their own language, this would not happen! Without this
it will be impossible to establish the laity in the truth.</q>
</p>

<p>
And why should they not have it in their own tongue? they
reasoned. Moses wrote in the language of the people of his
time; the prophets spoke in the tongue familiar to the men whom
<pb n='016'/><anchor id='Pg016'/>
they addressed; and the New Testament was written in the language
then current throughout the Roman world.
</p>

<p>
The translation of the Bible into English by John Wyclif,
in 1380, was the chief event in the beginning of the Reformation.
It also prepared the way for the revival of Christianity
in England, and the multiplying there of the Word by the millions,
for all the world, that has followed.
</p>

<p>
To make such a translation at that time, says Neander,
<q>required a bold spirit which no danger could appal.</q> For
making it Wyclif was attacked from various quarters, because,
it was claimed, <q>he was introducing among the multitude a
book reserved exclusively for the use of the priests.</q> In the
general denunciation it was declared that <q>thus was the gospel
by him laid more open to the laity, and to women who could
read, than it had formerly been to the most learned of the clergy;
and in this way the gospel pearl is cast abroad, and trodden
underfoot of swine.</q> In the preface to his translation, Wyclif
exhorted all the people to read the Scriptures.
</p>

<p>
A sense of awe and a thrill of joy filled the heart of the great
German Reformer, when, at the age of twenty, while examining
the volumes in the library of the university of Erfurt, he held
in his hands, for the first time in his life, a complete copy of the
Bible. <q>O God,</q> he murmured, <q>could I but have one of these
books, I would ask no other treasure.</q> A little later he found
in a convent a chained Bible. To this he had constant recourse.
</p>

<p>
But all these Bibles here, as elsewhere, save in England,
were in an ancient tongue, and could be read only by the educated.
Why, thought Luther, should the living Word be confined
to dead languages? Like Wyclif, therefore, he resolved
to give his countrymen the Bible in their own tongue. This he
did, the New Testament in 1522, and the Bible complete, the
crowning work of his life, in 1534.
</p>

<p>
Impressed with the idea that the people should read the
Scriptures in their mother tongue, William Tyndale, likewise,
in 1525, gave to the English his translation of the New Testament,
and later, of portions of the Old Testament Scriptures.
His ardent desire that they should know the Bible was well
expressed in the statement that if God spared his life he would
cause the boy that drives the plow to know more of the Scriptures
than was commonly known by the divines of his day.
</p>

<p>
The first complete printed English Bible was that of Miles
Coverdale, printed at Zurich, Switzerland, in 1535. Matthew's
Bible, Taverner's Bible, and The Great Bible prepared at the
suggestion of Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, appeared soon
after. Thus the light of truth began to shine forth once more;
but not without opposition.
</p>

<div>
<head>Burning of Bibles</head>

<p>
As Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes under King
Zedekiah showed their contempt for God by burning the writings
of Jeremiah, and confining the prophet in a dungeon (Jer.
36:20-23; 38:1-6), so now men sought to stem the rising tide
of reform by burning the Bible and its translators.
</p>

<p>
Bible burning was inaugurated in England by the destruction
of copies of the Antwerp edition of Tyndale's New Testament,
at St. Paul's Cross, London, in 1527, followed by the burning
of a second edition in 1530. A little later there were wholesale
burnings of the writings and translations of Wyclif, Tyndale,
Basil, Barnes, Coverdale, and others.
</p>

  </figure>
</p>

<p>
Forty-three years after the death of Wyclif, or in <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> 1428,
by order of the Council of Constance his bones were dug up and
burned. Oct. 6, 1536, by order of Charles V of Germany, Tyndale
was strangled and burned at the stake at Vilvorde, near
Brussels. <q>If Luther will not retract,</q> wrote Henry VIII of
England, <q>let himself and his writings be committed to the
flames.</q>
</p>

<pb n='018'/><anchor id='Pg018'/>

<p>
Such, under the spiritual tyranny that ruled in those times,
was the fate of many who stood for God and His Word.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>The Word Not Bound</head>

<p>
But the Word of God could not be forever bound. In attempting
to prevent its circulation men soon discovered that
they were undertaking a work beyond their strength.
</p>

<p>
The Bible had taken deep root in the hearts of the people.
What kings and prelates had sought to suppress and destroy,
kings and prelates now began to foster and supply.
</p>

<p>
In his <q>Stories From English History,</q>
pages 196, 197, Henry P. Warren
says: <q>Henry, by Cromwell's advice,
ordered a translation of the Bible
to be made in English, and a copy to
be placed in every church. There had
been English translations before, but
they had not been in the hands of the
people generally, and had only been
read secretly and in fear.... Cromwell
then appointed Cranmer and the
bishops to revise the Bible, and publish
it without note or comment; and
in the year 1539 a copy of the English
Bible was chained to the reading-desk
of every parish church. From that
time the Bible has never ceased to be
printed and sold freely.</q>

    <head>The Chained Bible</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
Says Charles C. Coffin, in his <q>Story
of Liberty,</q> page 44: <q>The people listen
to the reading with wonder and delight.
They begin to think; and when
men begin to think, they take a step
toward freedom. They see that the
Bible gives them rights which hitherto
have been denied them,&mdash;the right to
read, to acquire knowledge. Schools are started. Men and
women who till now have not known a letter of the alphabet,
learn to read; children teach their parents. It is the beginning
of a new life, a new order of things in the community&mdash;the
beginning of liberty.</q>
</p>

</div>

<div>
<head>The Bible to All the World</head>

<p>
Finally great Bible societies were organized in England,
America, and many of the countries of Europe, for the purpose
of giving the Bible to the world,&mdash;to every nation, kindred,
<pb n='019'/><anchor id='Pg019'/>
tongue, and people in its own language. Since its organization
in 1804, the British and Foreign Bible Society, up to 1912, had
published the Scriptures, or portions of them in 440 languages
and dialects, with a total of 53,274,516 entire Bibles, 84,059,610
New Testaments, and 89,816,644 portions of the Bible, or a
grand total of 227,150,770 copies.

  </figure>
</p>

<p>
The total issue of the American Bible Society in the first
ninety-six years following its organization, or from 1816 to 1912,
amounts to 96,219,105 copies. It now publishes the Bible in
over one hundred languages.
</p>

<p>
These, while the largest of their kind, are but two of the
twenty-seven Bible societies now disseminating the Scriptures.
</p>

<p>
Thus is the world being provided with the Word of God,
preparatory to the giving of the closing gospel message to all
mankind, the ending of the reign of sin, and the advent of the
Lord in glory. <q>And this gospel of the kingdom shall be
preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and
then shall the end come.</q> Matt. 24:14.

<head>The Value Of Bible Study</head>

<p rend='text-align: center'>
  <figure url='images/illus020.png' rend='width: 80%'>
    <head>The Forbidden Book. "God's Holy Word was prized when 'twas unsafe
to read it."</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
The Bible is God's great text-book for man. It is His
lamp to our feet and light to our path in this world of sin. The
value of Bible study cannot therefore be overestimated.
</p>

<p>
Considered from a literary standpoint alone, the Bible
stands preeminent. Its terse, chaste style; its beautiful and
impressive imagery; its interesting stories and well-told narratives;
its deep wisdom and its sound logic; its dignified language
and its elevated themes, all make it worthy of universal
reading and careful study.
</p>

<p>
As an educating power, the Bible has no equal. Nothing
so broadens the vision, strengthens the mind, elevates the
thoughts, and ennobles the affections as does the study of the
sublime and stupendous truths of revelation. A knowledge of
its principles is an essential preparation to every calling. To
the extent that it is studied and its teachings are received, it
gives strength of character, noble ambition, keenness of perception,
and sound judgment. Of all the books ever written,
none contains lessons so instructive, precepts so pure, or promises
so great as the Bible.
</p>

<p>
There is nothing that so convinces the mind of the inspiration
of the Bible as does the reading of the Bible itself, and
especially those portions known as the prophecies. After the
resurrection of Christ, when everything else seemed to have
failed to convince the disciples that He had risen from the dead,
<pb n='021'/><anchor id='Pg021'/>
He appealed to the inspired Word, and <q>expounded unto
them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself</q>
(Luke 24:25-27), and they believed. On another occasion He
said, <q>If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they
be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</q> Luke 16:31.
</p>

<p>
As a guide, the Bible is without a rival. It gives a calm
peace in believing, and a firm hope of the future. It solves
the great problem of life and destiny, and inspires to a life of
purity, patience, and well-doing. It fills the heart with love
for God and a desire to do good to others, and thus prepares
for usefulness here and for a home in heaven. It teaches the
value of the soul, by revealing the price that has been paid to
redeem it. It makes known the only antidote for sin, and
presents the only perfect code of morals ever given. It tells
of the future and the preparation necessary to meet it. It
makes us bold for the right, and sustains the soul in adversity
and affliction. It lights up the dark valley of death, and
points to a life unending. It leads to God, and to Christ, whom
to know is life eternal. In short, it is the one book to live by
and die by.
</p>

<p>
As the king of Israel was instructed to write him a copy of
the law, and to read therein <q>all the days of his life,</q> that he
might <q>fear the Lord,</q> keep His word, and thus prolong his
days and the days of his children (Deut. 17:18-20), so ought
men now to study the Bible, and from it learn that fear which
is the beginning of wisdom, and that knowledge which is unto
salvation. As an aid and incentive to this, <q>Bible Readings
for the Home Circle</q> has been prepared and published.
</p>

<div>
<head>Bible Readings; Their Value and Use</head>

<p>
Briefly stated, a Bible reading consists of questions asked
concerning some subject, and answers to them from the Bible.
In other words, Bible readings mean a topical study of the
Bible by means of questions and answers.
</p>

<p>
In either receiving or imparting knowledge, there is nothing
like the interrogation-point. Nothing so readily quickens
thought or awakens interest as a question. Children would
learn little if they asked no questions, and he would indeed be
a poor teacher who asked and answered none.
</p>

<p>
Knowing the value of this means of awakening thought,
arousing interest, and imparting information, God, in His wisdom,
inspired those who wrote the Bible to ask many questions,
that He might set us to thinking and studying about the great
themes with which it deals. See Job 38:4, 7; 14:14; Ps. 8:4;
Mal. 3:1, 2, 8; Ex. 32:26; 1 Chron. 29:5.
</p>

<p>
But God not only asks questions; He answers them. The
<pb n='022'/><anchor id='Pg022'/>
following may be cited as a few short Bible readings, taken,
both questions and answers, directly from the Bible itself:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days,
that he may see good?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking
guile. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue
it.</q> Ps. 34:12-14.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions?
who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath
redness of eyes?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek
mixed wine.</q> Prov. 23:29, 30.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall
stand in His holy place?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath
not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. He
shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness
from the God of his salvation.</q> Ps. 24:3-5. See also Psalm
15 and Isa. 33:14-17.
</p>

<p>
The Bible itself, therefore, sets the example of giving instruction
and of imparting most valuable information by means
of asking questions and answering them.
</p>

<p>
The readings in this book as originally prepared were contributed
by a large number of Bible workers, whose experience
in giving Bible readings had taught them the most effective
methods of presenting the different subjects treated. Over one
million two hundred and fifty thousand copies of the book as
thus prepared have been sold.
</p>

<p>
The work has recently been thoroughly revised and rewritten,
much enlarged, entirely reillustrated, with the readings
classified and carefully arranged according to topics, by a
large committee of able critics and Bible students. So extensive
has been the revision, and so much and valuable the new
matter added, that the present work is practically a new book,
although retaining the same name and the same general plan
as the former work. Thus prepared, it is once more sent forth
on its mission of light and blessing.
</p>

<p>
As a help in enabling the reader quickly to discover the
words which most directly answer the question asked, they are
generally printed in italic, unless the entire scripture quoted is
required for the purpose.
</p>

<p>
<q>Bible Readings</q> will be found an excellent aid to private,
family, and public study of the Word of God.

</p>

<p>
5. What specific instance is mentioned by Peter?

</p>

<p>
11. What estimate did Job place upon the words of God?

lips; <hi rend='italic'>I have esteemed the words of His mouth more than my necessary
food</hi>.</q> Job 23:12.
</p>

<p>
12. Upon what evidence did Jesus base His Messiahship?

</p>

<p>
<q>He is the Rock, His work is perfect: for all His ways are

is He.</q> Deut. 32:4.
</p>

<pb n='027'/><anchor id='Pg027'/>

<p>

138:2.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;God did this by backing His promises with an oath

His name, or character, for the fulfilment of His word.
</quote>

<p>
20. In what is the true poetry of life to be found?

<p>

<head>The Study Of The Scriptures</head>

<p rend='text-align: center'>
  <figure url='images/illus028.png' rend='width: 80%'>
    <head>Searching The Scriptures.
"Study to show thyself approved
unto God." 2 Tim. 2:15.</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
1. What did Christ say to the Jews concerning the study
of the Scriptures?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Search the Scriptures</hi>; for in them ye think ye have eternal
life: and they are they which testify of Me.</q> John 5:39
</p>

<p>
2. For what were the Bereans commended?
</p>

<p>
<q>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that
they received the word with all readiness of mind, and <hi rend='italic'>searched
the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so</hi>.</q> Acts 17:11.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;<q>If God's Word were studied as it should be,</q>
says a modern Bible student, <q>men would have a breadth of mind, a nobility of character,
and a stability of purpose that are rarely seen in these times. But there
is little benefit derived from a hasty reading of the Scriptures. One may
read the whole Bible through, and yet fail to see its beauty or comprehend
its deep and hidden meaning. One passage studied until its significance
is clear to the mind and its relation to the plan of salvation is evident, is
of more value than the perusal of many chapters with no definite purpose
in view, and no positive instruction gained.</q>
</quote>

<p>
3. By what comparison is it indicated that some portions
of God's Word are more difficult to understand than others?
</p>

<p>
<q>For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have
need that one teach you again which be <hi rend='italic'>the first principles of
<pb n='029'/><anchor id='Pg029'/>
the oracles of God</hi>; and are become such as have need of <hi rend='italic'>milk</hi>,
and not of <hi rend='italic'>strong meat</hi>.</q> Heb. 5:12.
</p>

<p>
4. In what way is this comparison further explained?
</p>

<p>
<q>For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of
righteousness: for he is a <emph>babe</emph>. But strong meat belongeth to
them that are of <emph>full age</emph>, even those who by reason of use have
their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</q> Verses
13, 14.
</p>

<p>
5. What writings are specifically mentioned as containing
some things difficult to understand?
</p>

<p>
<q>And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation;
even as our beloved brother <hi rend='italic'>Paul</hi> also according to the
wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; as also in all
<emph>his epistles</emph>, speaking in them of these things; <emph>in which are some
things hard to be understood</emph>, which they that are unlearned and
unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their
own destruction.</q> 2 Peter 3:15, 16.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Some scriptures are too plain to be misunderstood,
while the meaning of others cannot so readily be discerned. To obtain a comprehensive
knowledge of any Bible truth, scripture must be compared with
scripture, and there should be <q>careful research and prayerful reflection.</q>
But all such study will be richly rewarded.
</quote>

<p>
6. Who alone comprehends the things of God?
</p>

<p>
<q>For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the
spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth
no man, but <hi rend='italic'>the Spirit of God</hi>.</q> 1 Cor. 2:11.
</p>

<p>
7. How thoroughly does the Spirit search out the hidden
treasures of truth?
</p>

<p>
<q>But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit: for <hi rend='italic'>the
Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God</hi>.</q> Verse 10.
</p>

<p>
8. What is one purpose for which the Holy Spirit was sent?
</p>

<p>
<q>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the
Father will send in My name, <hi rend='italic'>He shall teach you all things, and
bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto
you</hi>.</q> John 14:26.
</p>

<p>
9. Why cannot the natural man receive the things of the
Spirit?
</p>

<p>
<q>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit
of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know
them, <hi rend='italic'>because they are spiritually discerned</hi>.</q> 1 Cor. 2:14.
</p>

<pb n='030'/><anchor id='Pg030'/>

<p>
10. For what spiritual enlightenment should every one pray?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Open Thou mine eyes</hi>, that I may behold wondrous things
out of Thy law.</q> Ps. 119:18.
</p>

<p>
11. For what spiritual gift did the apostle Paul pray?
</p>

<p>
<q>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
may give unto you <hi rend='italic'>the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
knowledge of Him</hi>.</q> Eph. 1:17.
</p>

<p>
12. Upon what conditions is an understanding of divine
things promised?
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, <hi rend='italic'>if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice
for understanding; if thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for
her as for hid treasures</hi>; then shalt thou understand the fear of
the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.</q> Prov. 2:3-5.
</p>

<p>
13. What great blessing did Christ confer upon His disciples
after His resurrection?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Then opened He their understanding</hi>, that they might understand
the Scriptures.</q> Luke 24:45.
</p>

<p>
14. What beings of a higher order than man desire to study
the truths revealed in the gospel of Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>Which things <hi rend='italic'>the angels</hi> desire to look into.</q> 1 Peter 1:12
</p>

<p>
15. What is promised him who wills to do God's will?
</p>

<p>
<q>If any man will [willeth to, R. V.] do His will, <hi rend='italic'>he shall know
of the doctrine</hi>, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of
Myself.</q> John 7:17.
</p>

<p>
16. How did Christ reprove those who, though familiar
with the letter of the Scriptures, failed to understand them?
</p>

<p>
<q>Jesus answered and said unto them, <hi rend='italic'>Ye do err, not knowing
the Scriptures, nor the power of God</hi>.</q> Matt. 22:29.
</p>

<p>
17. What are the Scriptures able to do for one who believes
them?
</p>

<p>
<q>And that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures,
<hi rend='italic'>which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith
which is in Christ Jesus</hi>.</q> 2 Tim. 3:15.
</p>

<p>
18. When asked by the rich young man the conditions of
eternal life, to what did Jesus direct his attention?
</p>

<p>
<q>He said unto him, <hi rend='italic'>What is written in the law? how readest
thou?</hi></q> Luke 10:26.

<l>It is one thing to read the Bible through,</l>
<l>Another thing to read to learn and do.</l>
<l>Some read it with design to learn to read,</l>
<l>But to the subject pay but little heed.</l>
<l>Some read it as their duty once a week,</l>
<l>But no instruction from the Bible seek;</l>
<l>While others read it with but little care,</l>
<l>With no regard to how they read, nor where.</l>
<l>Some read to bring themselves into repute,</l>
<l>By showing others how they can dispute;</l>
<l>While others read because their neighbors do,</l>
<l>To see how long 'twill take to read it through.</l>
<l>Some read it for the wonders that are there,&mdash;</l>
<l>How David killed a lion and a bear;</l>
<l>While others read it with uncommon care,</l>
<l>Hoping to find some contradictions there.</l>
<l>Some read as if it did not speak to them,</l>
<l>But to the people at Jerusalem.</l>
<l>One reads with father's specs upon his head,</l>
<l>And sees the thing just as his father said.</l>
<l>Some read to prove a preadopted creed,</l>
<l>Hence understand but little that they read;</l>
<l>For every passage in the book they bend</l>
<l>To make it suit that all-important end.</l>
<l>Some people read, as I have often thought,</l>
<l>To teach the book instead of being taught;</l>
<l>And some there are who read it out of spite.</l>
<l>I fear there are but few who read it right.</l>
<l>But read it prayerfully, and you will see,</l>
<l>Although men contradict, God's words agree;</l>
<l>For what the early Bible prophets wrote,</l>
<l>We find that Christ and His apostles quote.</l>
<l>So trust no creed that trembles to recall</l>
<l>What has been penned by one and verified by all.</l>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;When <q>the Word became flesh, and dwelt among
us,</q> the thought of God was revealed in human flesh. When holy men of God
<q>spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,</q> the thought of God was
revealed in human language. The union of the divine and the human in
the manifestation of God's thought in the flesh is declared to be <q>the mystery
of godliness;</q> and there is the same mystery in the union of the divine
thought and human language. The two revelations of God, in human flesh
and in human speech, are both called the <hi rend='italic'>Word of God</hi>, and both
are the <hi rend='italic'>Word of life</hi>. He who fails to find Christ thus in the
Scriptures will not be able to feed upon the Word as the life-giving Word.

it and to keep it.</q> Gen. 2:8-15.
</p>

<p>
7. What may be perceived through the things that are made?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>the invisible things of Him</hi> from the creation of the

</p>

<p>
10. What encouraging statement follows concerning the

</p>

<p>
<q>And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon
the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by Him that
liveth forever and ever, <hi rend='italic'>who created heaven, and the things that
therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the

<head>The Origin Of Evil</head>

<p rend='text-align: center'>
  <figure url='images/illus050.png' rend='width: 80%'>
    <head>The Fall Of Satan.
"I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
heaven." Luke 10:18.</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
1. With whom did sin originate?
</p>

<p>
<q>He that committeth sin is of the devil; for <hi rend='italic'>the devil sinneth
from the beginning</hi>.</q> 1 John 3:8.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Without the Bible, the question of the origin
of evil would remain unexplained.
</quote>

<p>
2. From what time has the devil been a murderer?
</p>

<p>
<q>Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father
ye will do. <hi rend='italic'>He was a murderer from the beginning</hi>, and abode
not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.</q> John 8:44.
</p>

<p>
3. What is the devil's relationship to lying?
</p>

<p>
<q>When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for <hi rend='italic'>he is a
liar, and the father of it</hi>.</q> Same verse.
</p>

<p>
4. Was Satan created sinful?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou wast <hi rend='italic'>perfect</hi> in thy ways from the day that thou wast
created, <hi rend='italic'>till iniquity was found in thee</hi>.</q> Eze. 28:15.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This, and the
statement in John 8:44, that he <q><hi rend='italic'>abode</hi> not
in the truth,</q> show that Satan was once
<hi rend='italic'>perfect</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>in the truth</hi>. Peter
speaks of <q>the angels that <hi rend='italic'>sinned</hi></q>
(2 Peter 2:4); and Jude refers to <q>the
angels which <hi rend='italic'>kept not their first
estate</hi></q> (Jude 6); both of which show that
these angels were once in a state of sinlessness and innocence.
</quote>

<p>
5. What further statement of Christ seems to lay the responsibility
for the origin of sin upon Satan and his angels?
</p>

<pb n='051'/><anchor id='Pg051'/>

<p>
<q>Then shall He say also unto them on the left hand, Depart
from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, <hi rend='italic'>prepared for the devil
and his angels</hi>.</q> Matt. 25:41.
</p>

<p>
6. What led to Satan's sin, rebellion, and downfall?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty</hi>, thou hast
corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy <hi rend='italic'>brightness</hi>.</q> Eze. 28:17.
<q>Thou hast said in thine heart, <hi rend='italic'>I will ascend into heaven, I will
exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount
of the congregation, in the sides of the north: ... I will be
like the Most High</hi>.</q> Isa. 14:13, 14.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In a word, pride and self-exaltation led to Satan's
downfall, and for these there is no justification or adequate excuse. <q>Pride goeth
before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.</q> Prov. 16:18.
Hence, while we may know of the origin, cause, character, and results of
evil, no good or sufficient reason or excuse can be given for it. To excuse
it is to justify it; and the moment it is justified it ceases to be sin. All sin
is a manifestation of selfishness in some form, and its results are the opposite
of those prompted by love. The experiment of sin will result finally
in its utter abandonment and banishment forever, by all created intelligences,
throughout the entire universe of God. Only those who foolishly
and persistently cling to sin will be destroyed with it. The wicked will
then <q>be as though they had not been</q> (Obadiah 16), and the righteous
shall <q>shine as the brightness of the firmament,</q> and <q>as the stars forever
and ever.</q> Dan. 12:3. <q>Affliction shall not rise up the second time.</q>
Nahum 1:9. See reading on <q>Origin, History, and Destiny of Satan,</q>
page 499.
</quote>

<p>
7. In contrast with the pride and self-exaltation exhibited
by Satan, what spirit did Christ manifest?
</p>

<p>
<q>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to
be equal with God: but <hi rend='italic'>made Himself of no reputation</hi>, and took
upon Him the form of a <hi rend='italic'>servant</hi>, and was made in the likeness of
<hi rend='italic'>men</hi>: and being found in fashion as a man, <hi rend='italic'>He
humbled Himself</hi>, and became obedient unto <hi rend='italic'>death</hi>, even
<hi rend='italic'>the death of the cross</hi>.</q>
Phil. 2:6-8.
</p>

<p>
8. After man had sinned, how did God show His love, and
His willingness to forgive?
</p>

<p>
<q>For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish,
but have everlasting life.</q> John 3:16.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Inasmuch as God, who is love, who delights in mercy,
and who changes not, offered pardon and granted a period of probation to man
when he sinned, it is but reasonable to conclude that a like course was
pursued toward the heavenly intelligences who first sinned, and that only
those who persisted in sin, and took their stand in open revolt and rebellion
against God and the government of heaven, were finally cast out of heaven.
Rev. 12:7-9.

</p>

<p>
1. What is sin declared to be?

</p>

<p>
2. What precedes the manifestation of sin?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then when <hi rend='italic'>lust</hi> hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin.</q>
James 1:15.

verse. <q>The wages of sin is <hi rend='italic'>death</hi>.</q> Rom. 6:23.
</p>

<p>
4. Upon how many of the human race did death pass as the
result of Adam's transgression?
</p>

<p>
<q>By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin;
and so <hi rend='italic'>death passed upon all men</hi>, for that all have sinned.</q>
Rom. 5:12. <q>In Adam <hi rend='italic'>all die</hi>.</q> 1 Cor. 15:22.
</p>

<p>
5. How was the earth itself affected by Adam's sin?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Cursed is the ground</hi> for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat
of it all the days of thy life; <hi rend='italic'>thorns also and thistles shall it bring
forth to thee</hi>.</q> Gen. 3:17, 18.
</p>

<p>
6. What additional curse came as the result of the first
murder?
</p>

<pb n='054'/><anchor id='Pg054'/>

<p>
<q>And the Lord said unto Cain, ... And <hi rend='italic'>now art thou
cursed from the earth</hi>, which hath opened her mouth to receive
thy brother's blood from thy hand; <hi rend='italic'>when thou tillest the ground,
it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength</hi>.</q> Gen. 4:9-12.
</p>

<p>
7. What terrible judgment came in consequence of continued
sin and transgression against God?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created
from the face of the earth.... The end of all flesh is come
before Me; for the earth is filled with violence.</q> <q>And Noah
was six hundred years old when <hi rend='italic'>the flood of waters</hi> was upon the
earth.... The same day were <hi rend='italic'>all the fountains of the great
deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened</hi>.</q> Gen.
6:7-13; 7:6-11.
</p>

<p>
8. After the flood, what came in consequence of further
apostasy from God?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower,
which the children of men builded. And the Lord said, Behold,
the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they
begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them,
which they have imagined to do. Go to, let Us go down, and
there <hi rend='italic'>confound their language, that they may not understand one
another's speech</hi>. So the Lord scattered them abroad from
thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build
the city.</q> Gen. 11:5-8.
</p>

<p>
9. Into what condition has sin brought the entire creation?
</p>

<p>
<q>For we know that the whole creation <hi rend='italic'>groaneth</hi>
and <hi rend='italic'>travaileth
in pain together</hi> until now.</q> Rom. 8:22.
</p>

<p>
10. What explains God's apparent delay in dealing with
sin?
</p>

<p>
<q>The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some
men count slackness; but is <hi rend='italic'>long-suffering to us ward</hi>, not willing
that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</q>
2 Peter 3:9.
</p>

<p>
11. What is God's attitude toward the sinner?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth</hi>, saith
the Lord God: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.</q> Eze.
18:32.
</p>

<p>
12. Can man free himself from the dominion of sin?
</p>

<p>
<q>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his
<pb n='055'/><anchor id='Pg055'/>
spots? <hi rend='italic'>then may ye also do good, that
are accustomed to do evil</hi>.</q>
Jer. 13:23.
</p>

<p>
13. What place has the will in determining whether man
shall have life?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that
heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And
<hi rend='italic'>whosoever will, let him take the water
of life freely</hi>.</q> Rev. 22:17.
</p>

<p>
14. To what extent has Christ suffered for sinners?
</p>

<p>
<q>He was <hi rend='italic'>wounded</hi> for our transgressions,
He was <hi rend='italic'>bruised</hi>
for our iniquities: the <hi rend='italic'>chastisement</hi> of our peace was upon Him;
and with His <hi rend='italic'>stripes</hi> we are healed.</q> Isa. 53:5.
</p>

<p>
15. For what purpose was Christ manifested?
</p>

<p>
<q>And we know that <hi rend='italic'>He was manifested to take away our sins</hi>;
and in Him is no sin.... He that committeth sin is of
the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this
purpose the Son of God was manifested, <hi rend='italic'>that He might destroy
the works of the devil</hi>.</q> 1 John 3:5-8.
</p>

<p>
16. What was one direct purpose of the incarnation of
Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; <hi rend='italic'>that
through death He might destroy him that had the power of death,
that is, the devil</hi>.</q> Heb. 2:14.
</p>

<p>
17. What triumphant chorus will mark the end of the reign
of sin?
</p>

<p>
<q>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth,
and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that
are in them, heard I saying, <hi rend='italic'>Blessing, and honor, and glory, and
power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb
forever and ever</hi>.</q> Rev. 5:13.
</p>

<p>
18. When and by what means will the effects of sin be removed?
</p>

<p>
<q>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night;
in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and
<hi rend='italic'>the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and the
works that are therein shall be burned up</hi>.</q> 2 Peter 3:10.
</p>

<p>
19. How will the curse of the confusion of tongues be brought
to an end?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>then will I turn to the people a pure language</hi>, that they
<pb n='056'/><anchor id='Pg056'/>
may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve Him with one
consent.</q> Zeph. 3:9.
</p>

<p>
20. How thoroughly will the effects of sin be removed?
</p>

<p>
<q>And God shall <hi rend='italic'>wipe away all tears</hi> from their eyes; and
there shall be <hi rend='italic'>no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed
away</hi>.</q> Rev. 21:4. <q><hi rend='italic'>And there shall be no more curse</hi>: but
the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it [the holy city];
and His servants shall serve Him.</q> Rev. 22:3.
</p>

<p>
21. Will sin and its evil results ever appear again?
</p>

<p>
<q>What do ye imagine against the Lord? He will make an
utter end: <hi rend='italic'>affliction shall not rise up the second time</hi>.</q> Nahum
1:9. <q>There shall be <hi rend='italic'>no more death</hi>.</q> <q>And there shall be
<hi rend='italic'>no more curse</hi>.</q> Rev. 21:4; 22:3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;That sin exists none can deny. Why it was permitted
has perplexed many minds. But He who can bring light out of darkness
(2 Cor. 4:6), make the wrath of man to praise Him (Ps. 76:10), and turn
a curse into a blessing (Deut. 23:5), can bring good out of evil, and turn
mistakes and downfalls into stepping-stones to higher ground. Heaven
will be happier for the sorrows of earth. <q>Sorrows remembered sweeten
present joy,</q> says Robert Pollock, in <q>The Course of Time,</q> page 29.
In the final outcome it will be seen that all things have worked together
for good to them that love God. Rom. 8:28. Cowper, despondent and
about to drown himself, was carried the wrong way by his driver, and went

<p>
1. What is revealed concerning God in the first verse of
the Bible?
</p>

<p>
<q>In the beginning <hi rend='italic'>God created the heaven and the earth</hi>.</q>
Gen. 1:1.
</p>

<p>
2. What contrast is repeatedly drawn in the Scriptures between
the true God and false gods?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thus shall ye say unto them, <hi rend='italic'>The gods that have not made
the heavens and the earth</hi>, even they shall perish from the earth,
and from under these heavens.... The portion of Jacob
is not like them: for <hi rend='italic'>He is the former of all things</hi>; and Israel is
the rod of His inheritance: The Lord of hosts is His name.</q>
Jer. 10:11-16. See Jer. 14:22; Acts 17:22-29; Rev. 14:6-10.
</p>

<p>
3. Through whom did God work in creating all things?
</p>

<p>
<q>In the beginning was <hi rend='italic'>the Word</hi>, and the Word was with
God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning
with God. <hi rend='italic'>All things were made by Him</hi>; and without Him was
not anything made that was made.</q> John 1:1-3.
</p>

<p>
4. Through whom is redemption wrought?
</p>

<p>
<q>But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while
we were yet sinners, <hi rend='italic'>Christ died for us</hi>. Much more then, being
now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through
Him.</q> Rom. 5:8, 9.
</p>

<p>
5. In what scripture do we learn that Christ, the active
agent in creation, is also the head of the church?
</p>

<pb n='058'/><anchor id='Pg058'/>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>For by Him were all things created</hi>, that are in heaven, and
that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones,
or dominions, or principalities, or powers: <hi rend='italic'>all things were created
by Him</hi>, and for Him: and He is before all things, and <hi rend='italic'>by Him
all things consist</hi>. And <hi rend='italic'>He is the head of the body, the
church</hi>: who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead; that in all
things He might have the preeminence.</q> Col. 1:16-18.
</p>

<p>
6. What scripture shows that the Creator is also the Redeemer?
</p>

<p>
<q>But now thus saith <hi rend='italic'>the Lord that created thee, O Jacob</hi>, and
He that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for <hi rend='italic'>I have redeemed thee</hi>,
I have called thee by thy name; thou art Mine.</q> Isa. 43:1.
</p>

<p>
7. Who is declared to be the source of power to the weak?
</p>

<p>
<q>Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting
God, the Lord, <hi rend='italic'>the Creator</hi> of the ends of the earth,
fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of His
understanding. <hi rend='italic'>He giveth power to the faint</hi>; and to them that
have no might He increaseth strength.</q> Isa. 40:28, 29.
</p>

<p>
8. What prayer of David shows that he regarded redemption
as a creative work?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Create in me a clean heart</hi>, O God; and renew a right spirit
within me.</q> Ps. 51:10.
</p>

<p>
9. Who keeps the heavenly bodies in their places?
</p>

<p>
<q>To whom then will ye liken Me, or shall I be equal?
saith <hi rend='italic'>the Holy One</hi>. Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who
hath created these things, <hi rend='italic'>that bringeth out their host by number</hi>:
He calleth them all by names by the greatness of His might, for
that He is strong in power; not one faileth.</q> Isa. 40:25, 26.
</p>

<p>
10. What can the same Holy One do for the believer?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now unto Him that is able to <hi rend='italic'>keep you from falling</hi>, and to
present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding
joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and
majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.</q>
Jude 24, 25.
</p>

<p>
11. What is the measure of the power which is available for
the help of the believer?
</p>

<p>
<q>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
the knowledge of Him: the eyes of your understanding being
<pb n='059'/><anchor id='Pg059'/>
enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of His calling,
and what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,
and what is the exceeding greatness of His power to us ward who
believe, <hi rend='italic'>according to the working of His mighty power, which He
wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead, and set
Him at His own right hand in the heavenly places</hi>.</q> Eph. 1:17-20.
</p>

<p>
12. How great was the deliverance of Israel from Egyptian
bondage?
</p>

<p>
<q>Ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee,
<hi rend='italic'>since the day that God created man upon the earth</hi>, and ask from
the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been
any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like
it?... <hi rend='italic'>Hath God assayed to go and take Him a nation from
the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders,
and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out
arm, and by great terrors</hi>, according to all that the Lord your
God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?</q> Deut. 4:32-34.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The great deliverance of Israel from bondage and
oppression in Egypt is but a type of the power of God displayed in the deliverance of
man from the bondage and slavery of sin. In both is seen a manifestation
of creative power.
</quote>

<p>
13. What scripture plainly states that it is creative power
which transforms the believer?
</p>

<p>
<q>For we are His workmanship, <hi rend='italic'>created in Christ Jesus unto
good works</hi>, which God hath before ordained that we should
walk in them.</q> Eph. 2:10.
</p>

<p>
14. Of what great work is the Sabbath both a memorial
and a sign?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Remember the Sabbath day</hi>, to keep it holy. Six days shalt
thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the
Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work,
thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man servant, nor thy
maid servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
gates: <hi rend='italic'>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea,
and all that in them is</hi>, and rested the seventh day: wherefore
the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</q> Ex. 20:8-11.
<q>It is a <hi rend='italic'>sign</hi> between Me and the children of Israel forever:
<hi rend='italic'>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth</hi>, and on the
seventh day He rested, and was refreshed.</q> Ex. 31:17.
</p>

<p>
15. Inasmuch as creation and redemption are both wrought
by the same creative power, of what besides the original creation
was the Sabbath given to be a sign?
</p>

<pb n='060'/><anchor id='Pg060'/>

<p>
<q>Moreover also I gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between
Me and them, <hi rend='italic'>that they might know that I am the Lord
that sanctify them</hi>.</q> Eze. 20:12.
</p>

<p>
16. Through whose agency is the material universe sustained?
</p>

<p>
<q>And He [Christ] is before all things, and in Him all things
<hi rend='italic'>hold together</hi>.</q> Col. 1:17, R. V., margin.
</p>

<p>
17. What statement shows that all things, both material
and spiritual, are sustained by the same personal agency?
</p>

<p>
<q>But to us there is ... one Lord Jesus Christ, <hi rend='italic'>by
whom are all things</hi>, and we by Him.</q> 1 Cor. 8:6.
</p>

<p>
18. Why is God worthy to receive glory and honor?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and
power: <hi rend='italic'>for Thou hast created all things</hi>, and for Thy pleasure
they are and were created.</q> Rev. 4:11.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;That comparatively modern view of creation known as
evolution, which rests upon human research rather than upon divine
revelation, and which substitutes an impersonal force for a personal Creator,
overthrows the very foundation of the gospel. Redemption is simply
the new creation, and the Creator is the Redeemer. The Head of the
original creation is the Head of the new creation. The original creation
was wrought through Christ by the power of the word; the new creation,
or redemption, is wrought in exactly the same way. The evolutionary
theory of creation inevitably involves an evolutionary theory of the gospel,
and sets aside the truth concerning sin, the atoning sacrifice of Christ,
and the necessity of becoming new creatures through faith in the saving
power of Christ.

<p>
17. What is God's love able to do for His children?

</p>

<p>
20. Can anything separate the true child of God from the
love of God?
</p>

<p>
<q>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels,

come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be
able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord.</q> Rom. 8:38, 39.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<q>And now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own self
with the glory which I had with Thee <hi rend='italic'>before the world was</hi>.</q>
John 17:5. <q>But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be

come forth unto Me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings
forth have been of old, <hi rend='italic'>from everlasting</hi>.</q> Micah 5:2. See

<q>And <hi rend='italic'>the Word was made flesh</hi>,
and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of
the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</q>
John 1:1, 14.

which is Christ the Lord.</q> Luke 2:11.
</p>

<p>
8. Why was it necessary that He should be born thus, and
partake of human nature?

</p>

<p>
11. How did Christ assert an equal proprietorship with His
Father in the kingdom?

sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together <hi rend='italic'>His elect</hi>
from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</q>
Matt. 24:31.
</p>

<p>
13. Who are equally joined in bestowing the final rewards?
</p>

<pb n='069'/><anchor id='Pg069'/>

Father]: for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and
that <hi rend='italic'>He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him</hi>.</q> Heb.
11:6. <q>For the Son of man shall come in the glory of His
Father with His angels; and <hi rend='italic'>then He shall reward every man according
to his works</hi>.</q> Matt. 16:27.

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In the texts (Matt. 16:27; 13:41; 24:31) in which
Christ refers to the angels as <q>His angels</q> and to the kingdom as <q>His
kingdom</q> and to the elect as <q>His elect,</q> He refers to Himself as <q>the
Son of man.</q> It thus appears that while He was on earth as a man, He
recognized His essential deity and His equality with His Father in heaven.
</quote>

<p>
14. What fulness dwells in Christ?
</p>

<p>

the Lord of hosts; I am the <hi rend='italic'>first</hi>,
and I am the <hi rend='italic'>last</hi>; and beside
Me there is no God.</q> Isa. 44:6.
</p>

<p>
16. In what scripture does Christ adopt the same expression?
</p>

<p>
<q>And, behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me,
to give every man according as his work shall be. I am Alpha

and the <hi rend='italic'>last</hi>.</q>
Rev. 22:12, 13.
</p>

<p>
17. Having such a wonderful Saviour, what are we exhorted
to do?
</p>

<p>
<q>Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed
into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, <hi rend='italic'>let
us hold fast our profession</hi>.
For we have not an high priest which cannot be
touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points
tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</q> Heb. 4:14, 15.

</p>

<p>
2. Why was He to be named <q>Jesus</q>?
</p>

4. Through whom are we reconciled to God?

Thy throne, <hi rend='italic'>O God</hi>,
is forever and ever.</q> Heb. 1:8.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Humanity.</hi> <q>When the fulness of the time was come, God sent
forth His Son, <hi rend='italic'>made of a woman</hi>, made under the law.</q> Gal. 4:4.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Sinlessness.</hi> <q><hi rend='italic'>Who

8. How did Christ show from the Scriptures that the promised
Saviour of the world must be both human and divine?
</p>

<p>
<q>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked
them, saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is He? They
say unto Him, <hi rend='italic'>The son of David</hi>.
He saith unto them, <hi rend='italic'>How then
doth David in spirit call Him Lord</hi>; saying, The Lord said unto
my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand, till I make Thine enemies
Thy footstool? <hi rend='italic'>If David then call him Lord, how is He his son?</hi></q>
Matt. 22:41-45.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Another has aptly put this important truth
concerning the union of the human and divine in Christ thus: <q>Divinity needed humanity
that humanity might afford a channel of communication between God and
man. Man needs a power out of and above himself to restore him to the
likeness of God. There must be a power working from within, a new life
from above, before men can be changed from sin to holiness. That power
is Christ.</q>
</quote>

<p>
9. What two facts testify to the union of divinity and
humanity in Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>Concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was
<hi rend='italic'>made of the seed of David according to the flesh; and declared to be
the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by
the resurrection from the dead</hi>.</q> Rom. 1:3, 4
</p>

<p>
10. How complete was Christ's victory over death?
</p>

<p>
<q>I am the first and the last: <hi rend='italic'>I am He that liveth, and was dead;
and, behold, I am alive forevermore</hi>, Amen; and have the keys of
<hi rend='italic'>hell</hi> and of <hi rend='italic'>death</hi>.</q> Rev. 1:17, 18. See
Acts 2:24.
</p>

<p>
11. How complete is the salvation obtained in Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore, <hi rend='italic'>He is able also to save them to the uttermost</hi> that
come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession
for them.</q> Heb. 7:25.
</p>

<p>

sincerity of the confession of their sins?

their deeds</hi>. Many of them also which used curious arts <hi rend='italic'>brought
their books together, and burned them before all men</hi>: and they
counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of
silver.</q> Acts 19:18, 19.
</p>

<p>
23. Through whom are repentance and forgiveness granted?
</p>

<p>
<q>The God of our fathers raised up <hi rend='italic'>Jesus</hi>, whom ye slew and
hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with His right hand

</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy

Ghost</hi> shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh
a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but
whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven
him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</q>
Matt. 12:31, 32.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;As the Holy Spirit
is the agent that convicts of sin, and
brings the offer of pardon through the Word, the denial of the Spirit's
work is the refusal of pardon. In other words, the only unpardonable
sin is the sin which refuses to be pardoned.
</quote>

neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</q> Verses 14, 15.
</p>

<p>
27. What exhortation is based on the fact that God has
forgiven us?
</p>

<p>
<q>And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, <hi rend='italic'>forgiving
one another</hi>, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.</q>
Eph. 4:32.
</p>

<p>
28. In what condition is one whose sins are forgiven?
</p>

<p>

covered. <hi rend='italic'>Blessed</hi> is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth
not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.</q> Ps. 32:1, 2.

</p>

<p>
3. How did he further explain the new birth?
</p>

<p>
<q>Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, <hi rend='italic'>Except a

<q><hi rend='italic'>The wind</hi> bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the

</p>

<p>
7. From what is a converted sinner saved?
</p>

<p>
<q>Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from

multitude of sins.</q> James 5:20. See Acts 26:14-18.
</p>

<p>
8. To whom are sinners brought by conversion?
</p>

<p>
<q>Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right

strengthen thy brethren</hi>.</q> Luke 22:31, 32.
</p>

<p>
10. What other experience is associated with conversion?
</p>

<p>
<q>For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are
dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any
time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears,
and should understand with their heart, and should be <hi rend='italic'>converted</hi>,
and I should <hi rend='italic'>heal them</hi>.</q> Matt. 13:15.

<p>
11. What gracious promise does God make to His people?

<q><hi rend='italic'>I will heal their backsliding</hi>, I will love them freely: for
Mine anger is turned away from him.</q> Hosea 14:4.
</p>

<p>
12. By what means is this healing accomplished?
</p>

<p>
<q>He [Christ] was wounded for our transgressions, He was
bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was
upon Him; and <hi rend='italic'>with His stripes we are healed</hi>.</q> Isa. 53:5.
</p>

<p>
13. What takes place when one is converted to Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore if any man is in Christ, <hi rend='italic'>he is a new creation</hi>:
the old things are passed away; behold, they are become new.</q>

</p>

<p>
14. What is the value of merely outward forms?
</p>

<p>
<q>For in Christ Jesus <hi rend='italic'>neither circumcision availeth anything,
nor uncircumcision</hi>, but a new creature.</q> Gal. 6:15.
</p>

<p>
15. Through what was the original creation wrought?

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;A beautiful statue once
stood in the market-place of an
Italian city. It was the statue of a Greek slave girl. It represented the
slave as tidy and well dressed. A ragged, uncombed little street child,
coming across the statue in her play one day, stopped and gazed at it in
admiration. She was captivated by it. She gazed long and lovingly.
Moved by a sudden impulse, she went home and washed her face and
combed her hair. Another day she stopped again before the statue and
admired it, and got a new idea. Next day her tattered clothes were
washed and mended. Each time she looked at the statue she found something
in its beauties to admire and copy, until she was a transformed child.
By beholding we become changed.

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Baptism is a gospel
ordinance commemorating the <hi rend='italic'>death</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>burial</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>resurrection</hi>
of Christ. In baptism public testimony is given
to the effect that the one baptized has been crucified with Christ, buried
with Him, and is raised with Him to walk in newness of life. Only one
mode of baptism can rightly represent these facts of experience, and that
is immersion,&mdash;the mode followed by Christ and the primitive church.

<pb n='102'/><anchor id='Pg102'/>

<p>
12. What will follow this union with Christ in His death and
resurrection?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall
also <hi rend='italic'>live with Him</hi>.</q> Verse 8.
</p>

<p>
13. In what working of God is faith to be exercised in connection
with baptism?

<p>
17. What question did the eunuch ask after Philip had
preached Jesus unto him?
</p>

<p>
<q>And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain
water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; <hi rend='italic'>what doth hinder
me to be baptized</hi>?</q> Acts 8:36.
</p>

<p>
18. In order to baptize the eunuch, where did Philip take
him?

</p>

<p>
21. How perfect is the unity into which believers are brought

also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all <hi rend='italic'>baptized into one
body</hi>, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or
free; and have been all <hi rend='italic'>made to drink into one Spirit</hi>.</q> 1 Cor.
12:12, 13.
</p>

<p>
22. After being united with Christ in the likeness of His
death and resurrection, what should the believer do?
</p>

2. What great gift comes with our acceptance of Christ?
</p>

<q>And this is the will of Him that sent Me, that every one

3. What is the first and primary evidence of our acceptance
with God?

4. Why did John write his testimony concerning God's
love and purpose in giving Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>These things have I written unto you that believe on the

life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God</hi>.</q>
Verse 13. <q>These are written, <hi rend='italic'>that ye might believe that Jesus is
the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life
through His name</hi>.</q> John 20:31.
</p>

<p>
5. What witness does the true believer in Christ have that
he is accepted of God?
</p>

<p>
<q>He that believeth on the Son of God <hi rend='italic'>hath the witness in
himself</hi>: he that believeth not God hath made Him a liar; because
he believeth not the <hi rend='italic'>record</hi> that God gave of His Son.</q>
1 John 5:10.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Faith and feeling
should not be confounded. Faith is ours
to exercise in the Word of God, regardless of our feelings, and often in opposition
even to our feelings. Many fail to accept the pardon and assurance
of the acceptance of Heaven, because they do not take God at His
word, but instead turn their attention to their changeable moods and feelings.
<emph>Faith</emph> always precedes the
<emph>joyful feelings</emph> which naturally result from
the assurance of forgiveness and acceptance. This order is never reversed.

</p>

<p>
1. What is the ground of justification on God's part?
</p>

<p>
<q>That being justified <hi rend='italic'>by His grace</hi>, we should be made heirs
according to the hope of eternal life.</q> Titus 3:7.
</p>

<p>
2. What is the means through which this justifying grace is
made available to the sinner?
</p>

<p>
<q>Much more then, being now justified <hi rend='italic'>by
His</hi> [<hi rend='italic'>Christ's</hi>] <hi rend='italic'>blood</hi>,
we shall be saved from wrath through Him.</q> Rom. 5:9.
</p>

<p>
3. How is justification laid hold upon?
</p>

<p>
<q>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified <hi rend='italic'>by faith</hi>
without the deeds of the law.</q> Rom. 3:28.
</p>

<p>
4. What is the only way sinners may be justified, or made
righteous?
</p>

<p>
<q>Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the
law, but <hi rend='italic'>by the faith of Jesus Christ</hi>, even we have believed in
Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ,
and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law
shall no flesh be justified.</q> Gal. 2:16.
</p>

<p>
5. What concrete example makes clear the meaning of this
doctrine?
</p>

<p>
<q>And He brought him [Abraham] forth abroad, and said,
Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to
<pb n='111'/><anchor id='Pg111'/>
number them: and He said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
And <hi rend='italic'>he believed in the Lord;
and He counted it to him for righteousness</hi>.</q>
Gen. 15:5, 6.
</p>

<p>
6. How is the righteousness thus obtained described?
</p>

<p>
<q>And be found in Him, not having thine own righteousness,
which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ,
<hi rend='italic'>the righteousness which is of God by faith</hi>.</q> Phil. 3:9.
</p>

<p>
7. Upon what basis is justification granted?
</p>

<p>
<q>And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the <hi rend='italic'>gift</hi>: for the
judgment was by one to condemnation, but <hi rend='italic'>the free gift</hi> is of
many offenses unto justification.</q> Rom. 5:16.
</p>

<p>
8. Upon what basis does the reward come to one who works?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of
grace, but of <hi rend='italic'>debt</hi>.</q> Rom. 4:4.
</p>

<p>
9. Upon what condition is faith reckoned for righteousness?
</p>

<p>
<q>But to him that worketh not, but <hi rend='italic'>believeth on Him that
justifieth the ungodly</hi>, his faith is counted for righteousness.</q>
Verse 5.
</p>

<p>
10. How does grace, as the ground of justification, exclude
righteousness by works?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace
is no more grace</hi>. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace:
otherwise work is no more work.</q> Rom. 11:6.
</p>

<p>
11. In what way are both Jews and Gentiles to be justified?
</p>

<p>
<q>Is He the God of the Jews only? is He not also of the Gentiles?
Yes, of the Gentiles also: seeing it is one God, which
shall justify the circumcision <hi rend='italic'>by faith</hi>, and uncircumcision
<hi rend='italic'>through faith</hi>.</q> Rom. 3:29, 30.
</p>

<p>
12. What statement testifies to Abraham's faith in God?
</p>

<p>
<q>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief;
but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; and <hi rend='italic'>being fully
persuaded that what He had promised, He was able also to perform</hi>.</q>
Rom. 4:20, 21.
</p>

<p>
13. What did this bring to him?
</p>

<p>
<q>And therefore <hi rend='italic'>it was imputed to him for righteousness</hi>.</q>
Verse 22.
</p>

<p>
14. How may we receive this same imputed righteousness?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed
to him; but for us also, to whom it shall be imputed,
<pb n='112'/><anchor id='Pg112'/>
<hi rend='italic'>if we believe on Him that
raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead</hi>.</q>
Verses 23, 24.
</p>

<p>
15. Why must justifying faith lay hold upon both the death
and the resurrection of Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>Who was <hi rend='italic'>delivered for our offenses</hi>,
and <hi rend='italic'>was raised again for
our justification</hi>.</q> Verse 25. See 1 Cor. 15:17.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The resurrection of
Christ, the promised Seed (Gal. 3:16),
was necessary in order to fulfil to Abraham the promise of an innumerable
seed; and therefore Abraham's faith in the promise of God, which included
the resurrection, was reckoned to him for righteousness. His faith laid
hold upon that which made imputed righteousness possible. See Heb.
11:17-19.
</quote>

<p>
16. What is inseparable from the experience of justification
by faith?
</p>

<p>
<q>Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that
through this man is preached unto you <hi rend='italic'>the forgiveness of sins</hi>:
and by Him all that believe are <hi rend='italic'>justified from all things</hi>, from
which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.</q> Acts
13:38, 39.
</p>

<p>
17. How has Christ made it possible for righteousness to
be imputed to the believer?
</p>

<p>
<q>For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners,
so <hi rend='italic'>by the obedience of one</hi> shall many be made righteous.</q> Rom.
5:19.
</p>

<p>
18. What prophetic declaration foretold this truth?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>In the Lord</hi> shall all the
seed of Israel be <hi rend='italic'>justified</hi>, and shall
glory.</q> Isa. 45:25.
</p>

<p>
19. What other prediction asserts the same great truth?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>By His knowledge shall My righteous servant justify many</hi>;
for He shall bear their iniquities.</q> Isa. 5:11.
</p>

<p>
20. What does the imputed righteousness of Christ enable
God to do, and still be just?
</p>

<p>
<q>To declare, I say, at this time His righteousness: <hi rend='italic'>that He
might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus</hi>.</q>
Rom. 3:26.
</p>

<p>
21. By what name is Christ appropriately called?
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise
unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and
prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.
In His days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely
<pb n='113'/><anchor id='Pg113'/>
and this is His name whereby He shall be called, <hi rend='smallcaps'>The Lord Our
Righteousness</hi>.</q> Jer. 23:5, 6.
</p>

<p>
22. What blessed experience follows upon the acceptance
of Christ as our righteousness?
</p>

<p>
<q>Therefore being justified by faith, <hi rend='italic'>we have peace with God</hi>
through our Lord Jesus Christ.</q> Rom. 5:1.
</p>

<p>
23. What does Christ thus become to the believer?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>He is our peace</hi>, who hath made both one, and hath
broken down the middle wall of partition between us.</q> Eph.
2:14.
</p>

<p>
24. On what basis is there no possibility of justification for
the sinner?
</p>

<p>
<q>Therefore <hi rend='italic'>by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified
in His sight</hi>: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</q> Rom.
3:20.
</p>

<p>
25. How does the death of Christ bear testimony to this?
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not frustrate the grace of God: for <hi rend='italic'>if righteousness
come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain</hi>.</q> Gal. 2:21.
</p>

<p>
26. What is proved by any attempt to be justified by the
law?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Christ is become of no effect unto you</hi>, whosoever of you are
justified by the law; <hi rend='italic'>ye are fallen from grace</hi>.</q> Gal. 5:4.
</p>

<p>
27. Why did Israel fail to attain unto righteousness?
</p>

<p>
<q>But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness,
hath not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore?
<hi rend='italic'>Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of
the law.</hi> For they stumbled at that stumbling-stone.</q> Rom.
9:31, 32.
</p>

<p>
28. What is revealed by the law?
</p>

<p>
<q>By the law is <hi rend='italic'>the knowledge of sin</hi>.</q> Rom. 3:20
</p>

<p>
29. What bears witness to the genuineness of the righteousness
obtained by faith, apart from the deeds of the law?
</p>

<p>
<q>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested,
<hi rend='italic'>being witnessed by the law and the prophets</hi>.</q> Verse 21.
</p>

<p>
30. Does faith set aside the law of God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Do we then make void the law through faith? <hi rend='italic'>God forbid</hi>:
yea, we <hi rend='italic'>establish</hi> the law.</q> Verse 31.
</p>

<pb n='114'/><anchor id='Pg114'/>

<p>
31. What scripture shows that the righteousness which is
received by grace through faith must not be made an excuse for
continuing in sin?
</p>

<p>
<q>What shall we say then? <hi rend='italic'>Shall we continue in sin, that grace
may abound? God forbid.</hi> How shall we, that are dead to sin,
live any longer therein?</q> Rom. 6:1, 2.
</p>

<p>
32. Does faith exclude works?
</p>

<p>
<q>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that <hi rend='italic'>faith without works
is dead</hi>?</q> James 2:20.
</p>

<p>
33. What is the evidence of genuine, living faith?
</p>

<p>
<q>Show me thy faith without thy works, and <hi rend='italic'>I will show thee
my faith by my works</hi>.</q> Verse 18.
</p>

<p>
34. What, then, are the visible proofs of genuine justification
by faith?
</p>

<p>
<q>Ye see then how that by <hi rend='italic'>works</hi> a man is justified, and not
by faith only.</q> Verse 24. See also verse 22.
</p>

<p>
35. What great exchange has been wrought for us in Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>For He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin;
that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.</q>
2 Cor. 5:21.
</p>

<p>
<q>God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation

16. What kind of worship results from false teaching?

<q><hi rend='italic'>But in vain they do worship Me</hi>, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men.</q> Matt. 15:9.
</p>

<p>
17. Can we close our ears to truth, and remain innocent

</p>

<p>
19. What will God allow to come to those who reject truth?
</p>

<p>
<q>Because they receive not the love of the truth, that they
might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them <hi rend='italic'>strong

damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</q>

</p>

<p>
21. What fate awaits blind teachers and their followers?

<p>
1. By what are men sanctified?
</p>

<p>
<q>Sanctify them <hi rend='italic'>through Thy truth</hi>: Thy word is truth.</q>
John 17:17.
</p>

<p>
2. To what knowledge would God have all men come?
</p>

<p>
<q>Who will have all men to be saved, and <hi rend='italic'>to come unto the
knowledge of the truth</hi>.</q> 1 Tim. 2:4.
</p>

<p>
3. After receiving a <hi rend='italic'>knowledge</hi> of the truth, what must one
do in order to be sanctified by it?
</p>

<p>
<q>God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation
through sanctification of the Spirit and <hi rend='italic'>belief of the truth</hi>.</q>
2 Thess. 2:13.
</p>

<p>
4. And what besides a mere belief in the truth is necessary?
</p>

<p>
<q>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
through sanctification of the Spirit, <hi rend='italic'>unto obedience</hi>.</q> 1 Peter
1:2.
</p>

<p>
5. What effect does obedience to the truth have?
</p>

<p>
<q>Seeing <hi rend='italic'>ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth</hi> through
the Spirit.</q> Verse 22.
</p>

<p>
6. How should the truth ever be cherished?
</p>

<p>
<q>Buy the truth, and <hi rend='italic'>sell it not</hi>.</q> Prov. 23:23.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;That is, buy the
truth at whatever sacrifice or cost, and sell
it under no consideration.

<pb n='132'/><anchor id='Pg132'/>

<p>
7. Does the Bible recognize what may be called <q>present
truth</q>?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in
remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be
established in the <hi rend='italic'>present truth</hi>.</q> 2 Peter 1:12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Some truths are
applicable in all ages, and are therefore
<emph>present</emph> truth for every generation; others are of a special character, and
are applicable to only one generation. They are none the less important,
however, because of this; for upon their acceptance or rejection depends
the salvation or loss of the people of that generation. Of this kind was
Noah's message of a coming flood. To the generation to whom it was
preached that message was <emph>present truth</emph>; to later generations it has been
<emph>past truth</emph>, and not a present, testing message. Similarly, had the first
advent message of John the Baptist, of the Messiah at hand, been proclaimed
in the generation either before or after John's time, it would
not have been applicable&mdash;would not have been <emph>present truth</emph>. The people
of the generation before would not have lived to see it fulfilled, and
to those living after, it would have been wrongly timed. Not so with
general truths, such as love, faith, hope, repentance, obedience, justice,
and mercy. These are always in season, and of a saving nature at all
times. Present truths, however, always include all these, and hence are
saving in character, and of vital importance.

<p>
8. What was the special message for Noah's day?
</p>

<p>
<q>And God said unto Noah, <hi rend='italic'>The end of all flesh is come</hi> before
Me; for the earth is filled with violence through them;
and, behold, <hi rend='italic'>I will destroy them with the earth. Make thee an
ark of gopherwood.</hi></q> Gen. 6:13, 14.
</p>

<p>
9. How did Noah show his faith in this message?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
moved with fear, prepared an ark</hi> to the saving of his house; by
the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the
righteousness which is by faith.</q> Heb. 11:7.
</p>

<p>
10. How many were saved in the ark?
</p>

<p>
<q>The long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah,
while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, <hi rend='italic'>eight souls
were saved by water</hi>.</q> 1 Peter 3:20.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Doubtless many who
were lost in the flood held, in a nominal
way, to faith in God; but the test as to the genuineness of this came with
Noah's special message; and the difference between their faith and his was
made plain when they rejected the saving truth for that time,&mdash;the warning
message concerning the coming flood.
</quote>

<p>
11. What special message was given to Jonah for Nineveh?
</p>

<p>
<q>So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the
word of the Lord.... And Jonah began to enter into
the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, <hi rend='italic'>Yet forty days,
and Nineveh shall be overthrown</hi>.</q> Jonah 3:3, 4.
</p>

<pb n='133'/><anchor id='Pg133'/>

<p>
12. What saved the people from the predicted overthrow?
</p>

<p>
<q>So the people of Nineveh <hi rend='italic'>believed</hi> God, and proclaimed a
fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the
least of them.... And God saw their works, that <hi rend='italic'>they
turned from their evil way</hi>; and God repented of the evil, that He
had said that He would do unto them; and He did it not.</q>
Verses 5-10. See Jer. 18:7-10.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;So likewise
would God have spared the antediluvian world
had they received Noah's message, and turned from their evil ways.
</quote>

<p>
13. What was the special mission of John the Baptist?
</p>

<p>
<q>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
The same came for a witness, <hi rend='italic'>to bear witness of the Light</hi>, that all
men through Him might believe.</q> John 1:6, 7.
</p>

<p>
14. What answer did he return when asked concerning his
mission?
</p>

<p>
<q>He said, <hi rend='italic'>I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make
straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias</hi>.</q> Verse 23.
</p>

<p>
15. What did Christ say of those who rejected John's
message?
</p>

<p>
<q>But the Pharisees and lawyers <hi rend='italic'>rejected the counsel of God
against themselves</hi>, being not baptized of him.</q> Luke 7:30.
</p>

<p>
16. What did those do who were baptized of John?
</p>

<p>
<q>And all the people that heard Him, and the publicans,
<hi rend='italic'>justified God</hi>, being baptized with the baptism of John.</q>
Verse 29.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;That is, they
honored God by this act, which showed their
faith in His truth for that time.
</quote>

<p>
17. Did God's chosen people receive Christ when He came?
</p>

<p>
<q>He came unto His own, and <hi rend='italic'>His own received Him not</hi>.</q>
John 1:11.
</p>

<p>
18. What reason did they give for not receiving Him?
</p>

<p>
<q>We know that God spake unto Moses: <hi rend='italic'>as for this fellow,
we know not from whence He is</hi>.</q> John 9:29.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;That was the
trouble; they had no faith in anything new.
They <emph>knew</emph> that God spoke by Moses: it required little faith to believe that.
They felt perfectly safe in accepting him, for everything had demonstrated
that he was sent of God. All could see that. But here was One whom,
although He had come in fulfilment of the prophecies of Moses and
the prophets as their long-looked-for Messiah, they felt there was a
risk in accepting, because they did not understand the prophecies
relating to Him, and time had not worked out to their satisfaction the
truthfulness of His claims. It required too much <emph>faith</emph>, as against their
<pb n='134'/><anchor id='Pg134'/>
desire to walk by <emph>sight</emph>, to accept Christ. It also called for a change of
views in some things, and a reformation in life. So they rejected Him.
They believed in the flood, faith in which had saved Noah; they believed
in Elijah also, and professed faith in all the prophets; but when it came
to this special truth for their time, they refused to accept it. Thus it
has been in all ages, and thus we may expect it to continue to be to
the end.
</quote>

<p>
19. How did Christ say those who rejected Him reasoned?
</p>

<p>
<q>Ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchers
of the righteous, and say, If we had been in the days of
our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in
the blood of the prophets.</q> Matt. 23:29, 30.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;While
they condemned the action of their fathers in slaying
the prophets whom God had sent with messages of reproof and warning
applicable to those times, they soon filled up the measure of the iniquity
of their fathers by putting to death the Son of God. This showed that
they would have done as did their fathers had they lived in their day.
Thus we see that present truths are testing truths.
</quote>

<p>
20. What was the result of the Jews' not accepting Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>And when He was come near, He beheld the city, and wept
over it, saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this
thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but <hi rend='italic'>now they
are hid from thine eyes</hi>.</q> Luke 19:41, 42. <q>Behold, your house
is left unto you <hi rend='italic'>desolate</hi>.</q> Matt. 23:38.
</p>

<p>
21. Is there to be a special message for the last days?
</p>

<p>
<q>Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye
think not the Son of man cometh. <hi rend='italic'>Who then is a faithful and
wise servant</hi>, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household,
<hi rend='italic'>to give them meat in due season</hi>?</q> Matt. 24:44, 45.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In the
last days a message will go forth which will be <q>meat
in due season</q> to the people. This must be the warning concerning the
Lord's soon coming, and the preparation necessary to meet Him. Because
such a message was not always preached, is no evidence that it is
not now to be proclaimed. In his farewell address to the Pilgrim Fathers
on their departure from Holland for America, John Robinson said: <q>The
Lord knoweth whether I shall ever see your faces more; but whether the
Lord hath appointed that or not, I charge you before God and His blessed
angels to follow me no farther than I have followed Christ. If God should
reveal anything to you by any other instrument of His, be as ready to
receive it as you ever were to receive any truth by my ministry; for I am
very confident that the Lord hath more truth and light yet to break forth
out of His Holy Word. For my part, I cannot sufficiently bewail the condition
of the Reformed churches, who are come to a period in religion, and
will go no farther than the instruments of their reformation. The Lutherans
cannot be drawn to go any farther than what Luther saw; and the
Calvinists, you see, stick fast where they were left by that great man of
God, who yet saw not all things. This is a misery much to be lamented;
for though they were burning and shining lights in their time, yet they
penetrated not into the whole counsel of God, but were they now living,
would be as willing to embrace further light as that which they first received.</q>
</quote>

<pb n='135'/><anchor id='Pg135'/>

<p>
22. What does Christ say of that servant who, when He
comes, is found giving <q>meat in due season</q>?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Blessed</hi> is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall
find so doing.</q> Verse 46.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;The coming of
Christ in glory has been the hope of the
faithful in all ages.
</p>

<p>
Luther declared: <q>I persuade myself verily, that the day of judgment
will not be absent full three hundred years. God will not, cannot, suffer
this wicked world much longer. The great day is drawing near in which
the kingdom of abominations shall be overthrown.</q>
</p>

<p>
Melanchthon said: <q>This aged world is not far from its end.</q>
</p>

<p>
Calvin bade Christians <q>not to hesitate, ardently desiring the day of
Christ's coming as of all events most auspicious;</q> and declared that <q>the
whole human family of the faithful will keep in view that day.</q> <q>We
must hunger after Christ, we must seek, contemplate,</q> he adds, <q>till the
dawning of that great day, when our Lord will fully manifest the glory of
His kingdom.</q>
</p>

<p>
Said Knox, the Scotch Reformer: <q>Has not our Lord Jesus carried
up our flesh into heaven? and shall He not return? We know that He shall
return, and that with expedition.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ridley and Latimer, who laid down their lives for the truth, looked
in faith for the Lord's coming. Ridley wrote: <q>The world without doubt&mdash;this
I do believe, and therefore I say it&mdash;draws to an end.</q>
</p>

<p>
Said Baxter: <q>The thoughts of the coming of the Lord are most sweet
and joyful to me. It is the work of faith and the character of His saints
to love His appearing, and to look for that blessed hope.</q>
</p>
</quote>

<p>
23. What will be the burden of the closing gospel message?
</p>

<p>
<q>Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His
judgment is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and
earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.... Babylon
is fallen, is fallen.... If any man worship the beast
and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his
hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.</q>
Rev. 14:7-10.
</p>

<p>
24. How are those described who accept this message?
</p>

<p>
<q>Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep
the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</q> Verse 12.
</p>

<p>
25. How earnestly is this work to be prosecuted?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways
and hedges, <hi rend='italic'>and compel them to come in</hi>, that my house may
be filled.</q> Luke 14:23.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This work is
now going on. In every part of the world the
sound of this closing gospel message is being heard, and the people are

go out ... obeyed." Heb. 11:8.</head>

</p>

<p>
1. What did the Lord command Abraham to do?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now the Lord had said unto Abram, <hi rend='italic'>Get thee out of thy
country</hi>, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house,
<hi rend='italic'>unto a land that I will show thee</hi>.</q> Gen. 12:1.
</p>

<p>
2. How did Abraham respond to this command?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>So Abram departed</hi>, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and
Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old
when he departed out of Haran.</q> Verse 4.
</p>

<p>
3. Of what was Abraham's obedience the fruit?
</p>

<p>
<q>By <hi rend='italic'>faith</hi> Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out
unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he
went out, not knowing whither he went.</q> Heb. 11:8, R. V.
</p>

<p>
4. What command did the Lord later give to Abraham?
</p>

<p>
<q>And He said, <hi rend='italic'>Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom
thou lovest</hi>, and get thee into the land of Moriah; <hi rend='italic'>and offer him
therefor a burnt offering</hi> upon one of the mountains which I will
tell thee of.</q> Gen. 22:2.
</p>

<pb n='137'/><anchor id='Pg137'/>

<p>
5. Upon what ground were the previous promises then renewed
to Abraham?
</p>

<p>
<q>And said, By Myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for <hi rend='italic'>because
thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,
thine only son</hi>: that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying
I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and
as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall
possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the
nations of the world be blessed; <hi rend='italic'>because thou hast obeyed My
voice</hi>.</q> Verses 16-18.
</p>

<p>
6. What enabled Abraham to endure the test?
</p>

<p>
<q>By <hi rend='italic'>faith</hi> Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac:
and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten
son.</q> Heb. 11:17.
</p>

<p>
7. Of what were the works of Abraham an evidence?
</p>

<p>
<q>Was not Abraham our father <hi rend='italic'>justified</hi> by works, when he
had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</q> James 2:21.
</p>

<p>
8. By his works what was shown to be perfect?
</p>

<p>
<q>Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and <hi rend='italic'>by works
was faith made perfect</hi>?</q> Verse 22.
</p>

<p>
9. In what statement of the scripture was Abraham's
obedience really implied?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, <hi rend='italic'>Abraham believed
God</hi>, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and
he was called the Friend of God.</q> Verse 23.
</p>

<p>
10. What kind of faith avails with God?
</p>

<p>
<q>For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything,
nor uncircumcision; but <hi rend='italic'>faith which worketh by love</hi>.</q> Gal. 5:6.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The faith which
justifies is the faith which works. Those
who say, and do not, are not men of faith. The obedience which is pleasing
to God is the fruit of that faith which takes God at His word, and submits
to the working of His power, being fully assured that what He has promised
He is able also to perform. This is the faith which is reckoned for righteousness.

back again to Jerusalem, seeking Him.</q> Verses 44, 45.

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This is how
many lose Jesus today. They suppose He is
in their <emph>company</emph>, but do not see to

Through carelessness it takes but a day to lose Him; but, when once lost,
it sometimes takes days of sorrowful searching, as it did Joseph and Mary,
to find Him again.

<p>
21. How did His questions and answers impress those who
heard Him?
</p>

<p>
<q>And all that heard Him <hi rend='italic'>were astonished at His understanding
and answers</hi>.</q> Verse 47.
</p>

<p>
22. With what words do the Scriptures conclude the record
of Christ's early life?
</p>

<p>
<q>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor
with God and man.</q> Verse 52.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Christ's early life
is a pattern for all children and youth. It
was marked by respect and love for His mother. He was obedient to
His parents, and kind to all. He hated sin, and to every temptation turned
a deaf ear. He sought to understand the reason of things, and so increased
in knowledge and wisdom. He was sympathetic and tender-hearted, and
ever ready to relieve the oppressed, the sorrowing, and the suffering. If we
love Christ, we shall love to talk of Him; our sweetest thoughts will be of
Him; and by beholding Him we shall be changed into the same image.

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In no other place
did Christ appear so much a reformer
as in Jerusalem, the headquarters of the Jewish religion, which religion,
though having come from Christ Himself, had degenerated into mere
formalism and a round of ceremony. Both the beginning and the close
of His ministry here was marked by a cleansing of the temple. See
John 2:13-18 and Matt. 21:12-16.

    <head>Christ Teaching The Multitude.
"Never man spake like this
man." John 7:46.</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
1. What report did the officers bring who were sent out by
the chief priests and Pharisees to take Jesus?
</p>

<p>
<q>Never man spake like this man.</q> John 7:46.
</p>

<p>
2. How did Christ teach the people?
</p>

<p>
<q>He taught them <hi rend='italic'>as one having authority</hi>, and not as the
scribes.</q> Matt. 7:29.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;<q>The teaching of
the scribes and elders was cold and formal,
like a lesson learned by rote. To them the Word of God possessed no vital
power. Their own ideas and traditions were substituted for its teaching.
In the accustomed round of service they professed to explain the law, but no
inspiration from God stirred their own hearts or the hearts of their hearers.</q>
</quote>

<p>
3. Why was Christ's preaching so impressive?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>His word was with power</hi>.</q>  Luke 4:32.
</p>

<p>
4. With what was He filled?
</p>

<p>
<q>And Jesus being <hi rend='italic'>full of the Holy Ghost</hi> returned from Jordan,
and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness.</q> Verse 1.
</p>

<p>
5. How freely was the Holy Spirit bestowed upon Him?
</p>

<p>
<q>For He whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God:
<hi rend='italic'>for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto Him</hi>.</q> John 3:34.
</p>

<p>
6. How had Christ's teaching by parables been foretold?
</p>

<pb n='152'/><anchor id='Pg152'/>

<p>
<q>I will open My mouth <hi rend='italic'>in a parable</hi>: I will utter dark
sayings of old.</q> Ps. 78:2.
</p>

<p>
7. How was this fulfilled?
</p>

<p>
<q>Without a parable spake He not unto them.</q> Matt.
13:34.
</p>

<p>
8. What question did Christ's wonderful teaching call forth?
</p>

<p>
<q>And when He was come into His own country, He taught
them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished,
and said, <hi rend='italic'>Whence hath this man this wisdom</hi>, and these mighty
works?</q> Verse 54.
</p>

<p>
9. What did Isaiah say Christ would do with the law?
</p>

<p>
<q>He will <hi rend='italic'>magnify</hi> the law, and
make it <hi rend='italic'>honorable</hi>.</q> Isa.
42:21.
</p>

<p>
10. Because some thought He had come to destroy the
law, what did Christ say?
</p>

<p>
<q>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the
prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I
say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle
shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever
therefore shall break one of these least commandments,
and shall teach men so, he shall be called least in the kingdom
of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same
shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I say unto
you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness
of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into
the kingdom of heaven.</q> Matt. 5:17-20.
</p>

<p>
11. What testimony did Nicodemus bear concerning Him?
</p>

<p>
<q>Rabbi, <hi rend='italic'>we know that Thou art a teacher come from God</hi>:
for no man can do these miracles that Thou doest, except God
be with him.</q> John 3:2.
</p>

<p>
12. What did Christ's words at Jacob's well lead the woman
of Samaria to ask?
</p>

<p>
<q>The woman then left her water-pot, and went her way into
the city, and saith to the men, Come, see a man which told me
all things that ever I did: <hi rend='italic'>is not
this the Christ?</hi></q> John 4:28, 29.
</p>

<p>
13. How were the two on the way to Emmaus affected by
Christ's conversation with them?
</p>

<p>
<q>And they said one to another, <hi rend='italic'>Did not our heart burn within
us, while He talked with us by the way</hi>, and while He opened to
us the Scriptures?</q> Luke 24:32.
</p>

<pb n='153'/><anchor id='Pg153'/>

<p>
14. In His teaching, to what did Christ direct attention?
</p>

<p>
<q>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded
unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself.</q>
<q>And He said unto them, These are the words which
I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must
be fulfilled, which were written in the <hi rend='italic'>law of Moses</hi>, and in the
<hi rend='italic'>prophets</hi>, and in the
<hi rend='italic'>Psalms</hi>, concerning Me. Then opened He
their understanding, that they might understand <hi rend='italic'>the Scriptures</hi>.</q>
Verses 27, 44, 45.
</p>

<p>
15. How did He encourage His disciples to look for the fulfilment
of prophecy?
</p>

<p>
<q>When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,
spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (<hi rend='italic'>whoso
readeth, let him understand</hi>:) then let them which be in Judea
flee into the mountains.</q> Matt. 24:15, 16.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Christ was a
faithful student, a consistent user, and a perfect
expounder, of the Scriptures. He met temptation with the Scriptures;
He proved His Messiahship by the Scriptures; He taught from the Scriptures;
and He told His disciples to look to the Scriptures as their counselor
and guide for the future.

<head>Parables Of Christ</head>

<p rend='text-align: center'>
  <figure url='images/illus154.png' rend='width: 80%'>
    <head>Lessons From Nature.
"Consider the lilies of the field, how
they grow." Matt. 6:28.</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
1. What reference is made in the Psalms to Christ's use of
parables?
</p>

<p>
<q>I will open My mouth <hi rend='italic'>in a parable</hi>:
I will utter <hi rend='italic'>dark sayings
of old</hi>.</q> Ps. 78:2.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;A parable primarily means
a <emph>comparison</emph> or <emph>similitude</emph>;
specifically it is a short story or narrative drawn from life or nature, by
means of which some important lesson is taught, or some moral drawn.
</quote>

<p>
2. From what sources did Christ usually draw His parables?
</p>

<p>
From nature and from every-day experiences.
</p>

<p>
3. For what are His parables noted?
</p>

<p>
<q>Our Saviour's parables are distinguished above all others
for clearness, purity, chasteness, intelligibility, importance of
instruction, and simplicity. They are taken mostly from the
affairs of common life, and are intelligible, therefore,
to all men.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Dr.
Albert Barnes, on Matt. 13:3.</hi>
</p>

<p>
4. Following one of His parables, what did Christ say?
</p>

<p>
<q>Who hath ears to hear let him hear.</q> Matt. 13:9.
</p>

<p>
5. What question did the disciples then ask?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the disciples came, and said unto Him, <hi rend='italic'>Why speakest
Thou unto them in parables</hi>?</q> Verse 10.
</p>

<p>
6. What reply did Christ make?
</p>

<p>
<q>He answered and said unto them, <hi rend='italic'>Because it is given unto
<pb n='155'/><anchor id='Pg155'/>
you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven</hi>, but to them it
is not given. For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he
shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him
shall be taken away even that he hath. Therefore speak I to
them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they
hear not, neither do they understand.</q> Verses 11-13.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Christ's object, therefore,
in using parables was to teach the
mysteries, or truths, of the kingdom of heaven,&mdash;truths not necessarily
difficult to understand, but which had long been hidden or obscured by
sin, apostasy, and tradition,&mdash;in such a way that the spiritually minded
and those desirous of learning the truth, might understand them, and the
worldly-minded and unwilling would not. When asked the meaning of
any parable, Christ readily explained it to His disciples. See Luke 8:9-15;
Matt. 13:36-43; Mark 4:33,34.
</quote>

<p>
7. After giving instruction by the use of parables, what
question did Christ ask His disciples?
</p>

<p>
<q>Jesus saith unto them, <hi rend='italic'>Have ye understood all these things?</hi>
They say unto Him, Yea, Lord.</q> Verse 51.
</p>

<p>
8. How extensively did Christ make use of parables?
</p>

<p>
<q>All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables;
and <hi rend='italic'>without a parable spake He not unto them</hi>.</q> Verse 34.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Parables are
simply stories. All, young and old, like to
hear a story. Story-telling is one of the most successful means of awakening
an interest, securing attention, and teaching, illustrating, and
enforcing important truths. Christ, the greatest of all teachers, recognized
this, and therefore made constant use of this method of instruction.
See reading on <q>Preaching the Gospel,</q> page 631.
</quote>

<p>
9. How did Christ suggest that His disciples follow His
example in teaching gospel truth?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then said He unto them, Therefore every scribe which is
instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that
is an householder, <hi rend='italic'>which bringeth forth out of his treasure things
new and old</hi>.</q> Verse 52.
</p>

<p>
10. Which are some of the most touching and soul-winning
of Christ's parables?
</p>

<p>
The parable of the lost sheep, and that of the prodigal son.
Luke 15:3-7, 11-32.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Each parable
is designed to teach some one great and important
truth. The first twelve in the list here given are intended to
teach the following lessons, respectively: (1) Good and evil in life and
judgment. (2) Value of the gospel. (3) Seeking salvation. (4) The visible
church of Christ. (5) Truths new and old. (6) Duty of forgiving
others. (7) Call at various epochs. (8) Insincerity and repentance.
(9) Need of righteousness. (10) Watchful and careful profession. (11)
Use of abilities. (12) Final separation of good and bad.

"A man approved of God ... by miracles
and wonders." Acts 2:22.</head>

  </figure>
</p>

<p>
1. What testimony did the chief priests and Pharisees bear
concerning Christ's work?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council,
and said, What do we? for <hi rend='italic'>this man doeth many miracles</hi>.</q>
John 11:47.
</p>

<p>
2. By what did Peter, on the day of Pentecost, say that
Christ had been approved by God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth,
a man approved of God among you <hi rend='italic'>by miracles and wonders and
signs, which God did by Him in the midst of you</hi>, as ye yourselves
also know.</q> Acts 2:22.
</p>

<p>
3. By what means did Christ claim to cast out devils?
</p>

<p>
<q>But if I <hi rend='italic'>with the finger of God</hi> cast out devils, no doubt the
kingdom of God is come upon you.</q> Luke 11:20. Matt. 12:28
says <q>by the <hi rend='italic'>Spirit</hi> of God.</q>
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Under the third
plague in Egypt,&mdash;that of turning the dust
into lice,&mdash;the magicians, failing to duplicate it, said to Pharaoh, <q>This
is the finger of God.</q> Ex. 8:18, 19.
</quote>

<p>
4. Upon what ground did Nicodemus rest his belief that
Christ was a teacher from God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Rabbi, we know that Thou art a teacher come from God:
<pb n='158'/><anchor id='Pg158'/>
<hi rend='italic'>for no man can do these miracles that Thou doest, except God be
with him</hi>.</q> John 3:2.
</p>

<p>
5. After the healing of the blind man, upon what charge did
some of the Pharisees seek to prove that Christ was not of God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of
God, <hi rend='italic'>because He keepeth not the Sabbath day</hi>.</q> John 9:16,
first part.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This was a
false charge. Christ did keep the Sabbath, but
not according to the Pharisees' idea of Sabbath-keeping. See reading on
<q>Christ and the Sabbath,</q> page 430.
</quote>

<p>
6. What question did others raise in opposition to this view?
</p>

<p>
<q>Others said, <hi rend='italic'>How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles?</hi>
And there was a division among them.</q> Same verse, last part.
</p>

<p>
7. What was the result of Christ's working miracles at His
first Passover?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, in the
feast-day, <hi rend='italic'>many believed in His name, when they saw the miracles
which He did</hi>.</q> John 2:23.
</p>

<p>
8. What question did the performing of these miracles lead
many to ask?
</p>

<p>
<q>And many of the people believed on Him, and said, <hi rend='italic'>When
Christ cometh, will He do more miracles than these which this man
hath done?</hi></q> John 7:31.
</p>

<p>
9. Why were many attracted to Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>A great multitude followed Him, <hi rend='italic'>because they saw His
miracles which He did on them that were diseased</hi>.</q> John 6:2.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;A miracle is
the display of divine or superhuman power in
some unusual or extraordinary manner; hence its nature to attract attention.
Christ fed the five thousand with the multiplied loaves and fishes,
and all men wondered. Every day God feeds millions of humanity with
the multiplied fruits of the earth, and no one marvels. Christ, by a
shortened process, changed water into wine, and everybody was astonished;
but every year God does this in the usual way&mdash;through the vine&mdash;in
almost limitless quantities, and no one is astonished. A divine miracle,
therefore, whenever performed, is wrought to heal and to save, and
to call attention to the source of divine power.

</p>

<p>
1. For what purpose did Christ come into the world?
</p>

<p>
<q>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
Christ Jesus came into the world <hi rend='italic'>to save sinners</hi>; of whom I am
chief.</q> 1 Tim. 1:15.
</p>

<p>
2. What constrained God to give His Son to die for man?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>God so loved the world</hi>, that He gave His only begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but
have everlasting life.</q> John 3:16. See 1 John 4:9, 10;
Rom. 5:8.
</p>

<p>
3. What did the prophet say Christ would be called to
endure?
</p>

<p>
<q>He was <hi rend='italic'>oppressed</hi>, and
He was <hi rend='italic'>afflicted</hi>, yet He opened not
His mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a
sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth.
He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall
declare His generation? for He was <hi rend='italic'>cut off out of the land of the
living</hi>: for the transgression of My people was He stricken.</q>
Isa. 53:7, 8.
</p>

<p>
4. Did Christ know beforehand the treatment He was to
receive?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then He took unto Him the twelve, and said unto them,
<hi rend='italic'>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by
<pb n='164'/><anchor id='Pg164'/>
the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished</hi>.
For He shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be <hi rend='italic'>mocked</hi>,
and <hi rend='italic'>spitefully entreated</hi>, and
<hi rend='italic'>spitted on</hi>: and they shall <hi rend='italic'>scourge
Him</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>put Him to death</hi>.</q> Luke 18:31-33.
</p>

<p>
5. How heavy was the burden which rested on His soul on
the night of His betrayal?
</p>

<p>
<q>And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee,
and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. Then saith He unto
them, <hi rend='italic'>My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death</hi>: tarry ye
here, and watch with Me.</q> Matt. 26:37, 38.
</p>

<p>
6. What prayer of Christ shows that the redemption of a
lost world trembled in the balance in that terrible hour?
</p>

<p>
<q>And He went a little farther, and fell on His face, and
prayed, saying, <hi rend='italic'>O My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass
from Me</hi>: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.</q> Verse 39.
</p>

<p>
7. How great was the agony of His soul?
</p>

<p>
<q>And being in an agony He prayed more earnestly: and His
sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the
ground.</q> Luke 22:44.
</p>

<p>
8. After He had prayed this remarkable prayer three times,
what occurred?
</p>

<p>
<q>And while He yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that
was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew
near unto Jesus to kiss Him. But Jesus said unto him, Judas,
<hi rend='italic'>betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss</hi>?</q> Verses 47, 48.
</p>

<p>
9. To what place was Christ taken?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then took they Him, and led Him, and brought Him <hi rend='italic'>into
the high priest's house</hi>. And Peter followed afar off.</q> Verse 54.
</p>

<p>
10. While at the high priest's house, how did Peter deny
Him?
</p>

<p>
<q>Another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow
also was with Him: for he is a Galilean. And Peter said, <hi rend='italic'>Man,
I know not what thou sayest</hi>. And immediately, while he yet
spake, the cock crew. And the Lord turned, and looked upon
Peter.</q> Verses 59-61.
</p>

<p>
11. To what insults was Christ subjected at the house of
the high priest?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>the men that held Jesus mocked Him, and smote Him</hi>.
And when they had blindfolded Him, <hi rend='italic'>they struck Him on the face</hi>,
and asked Him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote Thee?</q>
Verses 63, 64.
</p>

<pb n='165'/><anchor id='Pg165'/>

<p>
12. Where was Christ next taken?
</p>

<p>
<q>And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the
chief priests and the scribes came together, and <hi rend='italic'>led Him into
their council</hi>.</q> Verse 66.
</p>

<p>
13. What admission did they secure from Him as the basis
of condemning Him?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then said they all, Art Thou then the Son of God? And
He said unto them, <hi rend='italic'>Ye say that I am</hi>. And they said, What need
we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of His own
mouth.</q> Verses 70, 71.
</p>

<p>
14. What was the next step in their plan to secure lawful
authority to carry out their unlawful purpose?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the whole multitude of them arose, and <hi rend='italic'>led Him unto
Pilate</hi>.</q> Luke 23:1.
</p>

<p>
15. When Pilate desired Christ released, how did they remonstrate?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>they were the more fierce</hi>,
saying, <hi rend='italic'>He stirreth up the
people</hi>, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee
to this place.</q> Verse 5.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This has ever
been a favorite accusation of the enemies of
truth against the work of true reformers. The Romans at this very time
had a law forbidding the teaching of any new religion <q>whereby the minds
of men may be <emph>disturbed</emph>.</q>
</quote>

<p>
16. When Pilate heard that Christ was from Galilee, what
did he do?
</p>

<p>
<q>And as soon as he knew that He belonged unto Herod's
jurisdiction, <hi rend='italic'>he sent Him to Herod</hi>, who himself also was at
Jerusalem at that time.</q> Verse 7.
</p>

<p>
17. Who appeared to accuse Christ before Herod?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>the chief priests and scribes</hi> stood and vehemently
accused Him.</q> Verse 10.
</p>

<p>
18. To what indignities did Herod subject the Saviour?
</p>

<p>
<q>And Herod with his men of war <hi rend='italic'>set Him at naught</hi>, and
<hi rend='italic'>mocked Him</hi>, and
<hi rend='italic'>arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe</hi>, and sent Him
again to Pilate.</q> Verse 11.
</p>

<p>
19. What did Pilate propose to do when Christ was again
brought before him?
</p>

<p>
<q>I have found no cause of death in Him: <hi rend='italic'>I will therefore
chastise Him, and let Him go</hi>.</q> Verse 22.

<p>
20. Instead of consenting to His release, what did Christ's
accusers now demand?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>they were instant</hi>
[<hi rend='italic'>earnest</hi>] <hi rend='italic'>with loud voices, requiring
that He might be crucified</hi>. And the voices of them and of the
chief priests prevailed.</q> Verse 23.
</p>

<p>
21. Although Pilate had declared his belief in Christ's innocence,
yet what cruel punishment did he inflict upon Him?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and <hi rend='italic'>scourged Him</hi>.</q>
John 19:1.
</p>

<p>
22. What shameful treatment did Christ receive from the
soldiers?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon
His head</hi>, and a reed in His right hand: and they bowed the knee
before Him, and mocked Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
<hi rend='italic'>And they spit upon Him, and took the reed, and smote Him on the
head.</hi></q> Matt. 27:29, 30.
</p>

<p>
23. After bringing Him to the place of crucifixion, what
drink was offered Christ to stupefy Him?
</p>

He had tasted thereof, He would not drink.</q> Verse 34.
</p>

<p>
24. In what prayer for those who crucified Him did Christ
manifest the true spirit of the gospel,&mdash;love for sinners?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then said Jesus, <hi rend='italic'>Father, forgive them; for they know not what
they do</hi>.</q> Luke 23:34.
</p>

<p>
25. With what words did the chief priests and others mock
Jesus while on the cross?
</p>

<p>
<q>Likewise also the chief priests mocking Him, with the
scribes and elders, said, <hi rend='italic'>He saved others; Himself He cannot save</hi>.
If He be the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the
cross, and we will believe Him.</q> Matt. 27:41, 42.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In their blindness they
could not see that Christ could not
save others and save Himself at the same time.
</quote>

<p>
26. As He cried out in agony on the cross, and said, <q>I
thirst,</q> what was given Him?

</p>

<p>
28. By what miracle, and phenomenon in nature did God indicate
the character of the deed which was being committed?

<p>
<q>And it was about the sixth hour [noon], and <hi rend='italic'>there was a

Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings</hi>.</q> Heb. 2:10.
</p>

<p>
30. For whom did Christ suffer all these things?
</p>

<p>
<q>He was <hi rend='italic'>wounded for our
transgressions</hi>, He was <hi rend='italic'>bruised for
our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and
with His stripes we are healed</hi>.</q> Isa. 53:5.
</p>

<p>
31. How much was included in the gift of Christ for the
salvation of man?

<q>He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for
us all, <hi rend='italic'>how shall He not
with Him also freely give us all things?</hi></q>

</p>

<p>
1. In what psalm was the resurrection of Christ foretold?
</p>

<p>
<q>For Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell [Heb., <hi rend='italic'>Sheol</hi>, the
grave]: neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption.</q>
Ps. 16:10.
</p>

<p>
2. In what way was Jonah a type of Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's
belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in
the heart of the earth.</q> Matt. 12:40.
</p>

<p>
3. In what plain words did Christ foretell His resurrection?
</p>

<p>
<q>From that time forth began Jesus to show unto His disciples,
how that He must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many
things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed,
<hi rend='italic'>and be raised again the third day</hi>.</q> Matt. 16:21. <q>And while
they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man
shall be betrayed into the hands of men: and they shall kill
Him, <hi rend='italic'>and the third day He shall be raised again</hi>.</q> Matt. 17:
22, 23. <q>The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected
of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain,
<hi rend='italic'>and be raised the third day</hi>.</q> Luke 9:22. See also Matt.
20:17-19; Mark 8:31; 9:31, 32; 10:32-34; Luke 18:31-34.
</p>

<p>
4. When asked by the Jews for a sign of His Messiahship,
what did Jesus say?
</p>

<pb n='170'/><anchor id='Pg170'/>

<p>
<q>Jesus answered and said unto them, <hi rend='italic'>Destroy this temple,
and in three days I will raise it up</hi>.</q> John 2:19.
</p>

<p>
5. To what temple did He refer?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple
in building, and wilt Thou rear it up in three days? But <hi rend='italic'>He
spake of the temple of His body</hi>.</q> Verses 20, 21.
</p>

<p>
6. After His resurrection, what effect had this prediction
upon His disciples?
</p>

<p>
<q>When therefore He was risen from the dead, His disciples
remembered that He had said this unto them; and <hi rend='italic'>they believed
the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said</hi>.</q> Verse 22.
</p>

<p>
7. How did the chief priests and Pharisees seek to prevent
the fulfilment of Christ's words concerning His resurrection?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation,
the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,
saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while He was
yet alive, After three days I will rise again. <hi rend='italic'>Command therefore
that the sepulcher be made sure until the third day</hi>, lest His
disciples come by night, and steal Him away, and say unto the
people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse
than the first.</q> Matt. 27:62-64.
</p>

<p>
8. How did Pilate comply with their request?
</p>

<p>
<q>Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way,
<hi rend='italic'>make it as sure as ye can</hi>. So they went, and made the sepulcher
sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</q> Verses 65, 66.
</p>

<p>
9. How futile was all this?
</p>

<p>
<q>In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the
first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other
Mary to see the sepulcher. And, behold, there was a great
earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven,
and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon
it. His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white
as snow: and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became
as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto the women,
Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
He is not here: for <hi rend='italic'>He is risen, as He said</hi>. Come, see the place
where the Lord lay. And go quickly, and tell His disciples that
<hi rend='italic'>He is risen from the dead</hi>.</q> Matt. 28:1-7. See also Mark 16:1-16;
Luke 24:1-8, 44-46; John 20:1-9.
</p>

<p>
10. Was it possible for Christ to be holden of death?
</p>

<p>
<q>Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge
of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have
crucified and slain: whom God hath raised up, having loosed
the pains of death: <hi rend='italic'>because it was not possible that He should be
holden of it</hi>.</q> Acts 2:23,24.

11. How does Paul speak of the resurrection of Christ?

of <hi rend='italic'>the twelve</hi>: after that, He
was seen of <hi rend='italic'>above five hundred brethren at once</hi>; ... after
that, He was seen of <hi rend='italic'>James</hi>;

of all He was seen of <hi rend='italic'>me</hi> also, as of one born out of due time.</q>

</p>

<p>
13. What importance is attached to Christ's resurrection?
</p>

<p>
<q>If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your
faith is also vain.... Ye are yet in your sins. Then they also
which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.</q> Verses 14-18.
</p>

<p>
14. What positive assurance of the resurrection is given?
</p>

<p>
<q>But <hi rend='italic'>now is Christ risen
from the dead</hi>, and become the first-fruits
of them that slept.</q> Verse 20.
</p>

<p>
15. What great truth therefore follows?
</p>

<p>
<q>As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
alive.</q> Verse 22.
</p>

<p>
16. What cheering message has Christ sent to His people
touching His resurrection?
</p>

<p>
<q>I am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, <hi rend='italic'>I am alive
forevermore</hi>, Amen; <hi rend='italic'>and have
the keys of hell and of death</hi>.</q> Rev.
1:18.
</p>

<p>
17. What is the measure of the power of God which believers
may experience in their daily lives?
</p>

<p>
<q>That ye may know ... the exceeding greatness of
His power to us ward who believe, <hi rend='italic'>according to the working of
His mighty power, which He wrought in Christ, when He raised
Him from the dead</hi>.</q> Eph. 1:18-20.

<q><hi rend='italic'>Who did no sin</hi>, neither was guile found in His mouth.</q>
1 Peter 2:22.

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>For all have sinned</hi>, and come short of the glory of God.</q>
Rom. 3:23.

3. With what question did Christ challenge His enemies?

<p>
<q>Which of you convinceth Me of sin?</q> John 8:46.

<p>
4. To what extent was Christ tempted?
</p>

<p>
<q>[He] was <hi rend='italic'>in all points tempted like as we are</hi>, yet without
sin.</q> Heb. 4:15.
</p>

<p>
5. In His humanity, of what nature did Christ partake?
</p>

<p>
<q>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
blood, <hi rend='italic'>He also Himself likewise took part of the same</hi>; that through
death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that
is, the devil.</q> Heb. 2:14.
</p>

<p>
6. How fully did Christ share our common humanity?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore <hi rend='italic'>in all things it behooved Him to be made like unto
His brethren</hi>, that He might be a merciful and faithful high
<pb n='174'/><anchor id='Pg174'/>
priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for
the sins of the people.</q> Verse 17.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In His humanity
Christ partook of our sinful, fallen nature.
If not, then He was not <q>made like unto His brethren,</q> was not <q>in all
points tempted like as we are,</q> did not overcome as we have to overcome,
and is not, therefore, the complete and perfect Saviour man needs and must
have to be saved. The idea that Christ was born of an immaculate or
sinless mother, inherited no tendencies to sin, and for this reason did not
sin, removes Him from the realm of a fallen world, and from the very place
where help is needed. On His human side, Christ inherited just what every
child of Adam inherits&mdash;a sinful nature. On the divine side, from His
very conception He was begotten and born of the Spirit. And all this was
done to place mankind on vantage-ground, and to demonstrate that <emph>in the
same way</emph> every one who is <q>born of the Spirit</q> may gain like victories
over sin in his own sinful flesh. Thus each one is to overcome <emph>as Christ
overcame</emph>. Rev. 3:21. Without this birth there can be no victory over
temptation, and no salvation from sin. John 3:3-7.
</quote>

<p>
7. Where did God, in Christ, condemn sin, and gain the
victory for us over temptation and sin?
</p>

<p>
<q>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through
the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful
flesh, and for sin, <hi rend='italic'>condemned sin in the flesh</hi>.</q> Rom. 8:3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;God, in Christ, condemned
sin, not by pronouncing against
it merely as a judge sitting on the judgment-seat, but by coming and living
<emph>in the flesh, in sinful flesh</emph>, and yet without sinning. In Christ, He
demonstrated that it is possible, by His grace and power, to resist temptation,
overcome sin, and <emph>live a sinless life in sinful flesh</emph>.
</quote>

<p>
8. By whose power did Christ live the perfect life?
</p>

<p>
<q>I can of Mine own self do nothing.</q> John 5:30. <q>The
words that I speak unto you I speak not of Myself: but <hi rend='italic'>the
Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works</hi>.</q> John 14:10.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In His humanity
Christ was as dependent upon divine power
to do the works of God as is any man to do the same thing. He employed
no means to live a holy life that are not available to every human being.
Through Him, every one may have God dwelling in him and working in
him <q>to <emph>will</emph> and to <emph>do</emph>
of His good pleasure.</q> 1 John 4:15; Phil. 2:13.

9. What unselfish purpose did Jesus ever have before Him?

that He may abide with you forever.</q> John 14:16.
</p>

<p>
2. Who is the Comforter, and what was He to do?
</p>

<p>
<q>But the Comforter, even <hi rend='italic'>the Holy Spirit</hi>, whom the Father
will send in My name, <hi rend='italic'>He shall teach you all things</hi>, and bring
to your remembrance all that I said unto you.</q> Verse 26, R. V.
</p>

<p>
3. Why cannot the world receive Him?
</p>

<p>
<q>Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive,
<hi rend='italic'>because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him</hi>.</q> Verse 17.
</p>

<p>
4. How intimate is His union with believers?
</p>

<p>
<q>But ye know Him; for <hi rend='italic'>He dwelleth with you</hi>, and shall be
<hi rend='italic'>in you</hi>.</q> Same verse.

<hi rend='italic'>ye in Me</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>I in you</hi>.</q> Verse 20.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Rom. 8:9 shows
the Spirit of each of the three persons of the
Godhead to be one and the same Spirit.
</quote>

<p>
8. How does Jesus, through the Spirit, seek an entrance
to every heart?
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, <hi rend='italic'>I stand at the door, and knock</hi>: if any man hear My
voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with
him, and he with Me.</q> Rev. 3:20.
</p>

<p>
9. Why was it necessary for Christ to go away?
</p>

<p>
<q>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you
that I go away: for <hi rend='italic'>if I go not away, the Comforter will not come
unto you</hi>; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you.</q> John
16:7.
</p>

<p>
10. What was the Comforter to do when He came?
</p>

<p>
<q>And when He is come, He will <hi rend='italic'>reprove</hi>

<p>
11. By what other title is the Comforter designated?
</p>

<p>
<q>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto
you from the Father, even <hi rend='italic'>the Spirit of truth</hi>, which proceedeth
from the Father, He shall testify of Me.</q> John 15:26.
</p>

<p>
12. What did Jesus say the Spirit of truth would do?
</p>

<p>
<q>Howbeit when He, the Spirit of truth, is come, <hi rend='italic'>He will
guide you into all truth</hi>: for He shall not speak of Himself; but
whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak: and <hi rend='italic'>He will
show you things to come</hi>.</q> John 16:13.

<p>
13. Whom did Christ say the Holy Spirit would glorify?
</p>

<p>
<q>He shall glorify <hi rend='italic'>Me</hi>: for He shall receive of Mine, and shall
show it unto you.</q> Verse 14.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;It is plain from these
scriptures that the Holy Spirit is the
personal representative of Christ upon the earth, abiding in the church by
dwelling in the hearts of the believers. It follows that any attempt to
make a man the vicegerent of Christ in the place of the third person of the
Godhead is an attempt to put man in the place of God. Thus does the
fundamental principle of the Papacy set aside the person and work of the
Holy Spirit.

14. How has God revealed to us the hidden things of the
kingdom?
</p>

<pb n='183'/><anchor id='Pg183'/>

<p>
<q>But God hath revealed them unto us <hi rend='italic'>by His Spirit</hi>: for
the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</q>
1 Cor. 2:10.
</p>

<p>
15. Who moved upon the prophets to give their messages?
</p>

<p>
<q>For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man:
but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the <hi rend='italic'>Holy
Ghost</hi>.</q> 2 Peter 1:21.
</p>

<p>
16. After Pentecost, how was the gospel preached?
</p>

<p>
<q>With the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.</q> 1 Peter
1:12.
</p>

<p>
17. How are believers sealed?
</p>

<p>
<q>In whom also after that ye believed, ye were <hi rend='italic'>sealed with
that Holy Spirit of promise</hi>.</q> Eph. 1:13.
</p>

<p>
18. What warning is therefore given?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God</hi>, whereby ye are sealed
unto the day of redemption.</q> Eph. 4:30.
</p>

<p>
19. Is there a limit to the strivings of God's Spirit?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Lord said, My Spirit shall not always strive with
man.</q> Gen. 6:3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The limit is
determined by the creature rather than by the
Creator. It is when there is an utter abandonment to evil, and further
appeals would be without avail. God foreknowing all things, may designate
a definite period of probation for man, as in the case of the one hundred
and twenty years before the flood (Gen. 6:3); but His Spirit never ceases to
strive with man as long as there is hope of his salvation.

<q>Cast me not away from Thy presence; and <hi rend='italic'>take not Thy

</p>

<p>
21. How willing is God to give to us the Holy Spirit?
</p>

<p>
<q>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto
your children: how much more shall your Heavenly Father
give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?</q> Luke 11:13.

goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.</q> Gal. 5:22, 23.
</p>

<p>
2. What are the works of the flesh?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these;
Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry,
witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions,
heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such

<p>
5. What is love declared to be?

<q>And above all these things put on love, which is the <hi rend='italic'>bond of

</p>

<p>
6. By what does genuine faith work?
</p>

<p>
<q>For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything,
nor uncircumcision; but <hi rend='italic'>faith which worketh by love</hi>.</q> Gal. 5:6.
</p>

<p>
7. What does love do?
</p>

<p>
<q>Hatred stirreth up strifes: but <hi rend='italic'>love
covereth all sins</hi>.</q> Prov.
10:12. <q>Have fervent charity among yourselves: for <hi rend='italic'>charity
shall cover the multitude of sins</hi>.</q> 1 Peter 4:8.
</p>

<p>
8. Of what does the kingdom of God consist?

<q>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but <hi rend='italic'>righteousness</hi>,

in the Holy Ghost.</q> Rom. 14:17.

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note</hi>.&mdash;It is the
Christian's privilege to have righteousness, peace,

give nor take away; and a joy that rejoices evermore (1 Thess. 5:16;
Phil. 4:4).

9. In what way does love manifest itself?

<q>And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but <hi rend='italic'>be gentle
unto all men</hi>.</q> 2 Tim. 2:24.

12. What does the goodness of God do?
</p>

<p>
<q>Or despisest thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance

leadeth thee to repentance</hi>?</q> Rom. 2:4.

<p>
13. How should we treat those who have wronged us?
</p>

<p>
<q>Dearly beloved, <hi rend='italic'>avenge not yourselves</hi>, but rather give place
unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay,
saith the Lord. Therefore <hi rend='italic'>if thine enemy hunger, feed him;
if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of
fire on his head</hi>.</q> Rom. 12:19, 20.

14. How does faith determine our standing with God?
</p>

<pb n='186'/><anchor id='Pg186'/>

<p>
<q>But <hi rend='italic'>without faith it is impossible to please Him</hi>: for he that
cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder

15. How does God regard the meek and quiet spirit?

</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note</hi>.&mdash;One of the
briefest and best definitions of temperance is
<emph>self-control</emph>. The word in the text means much more than mere abstinence
from intoxicating drinks,&mdash;the limited sense now frequently given to it. It
means control, strength, power, or ascendency over exciting and evil
passions of all kinds. It denotes the self-rule which the overcomer or
converted man has over the evil propensities of his nature. Commenting
on this passage, Dr. Albert Barnes says: <q>The influences of the Holy
Spirit on the heart make a man <emph>moderate</emph> in all indulgences; teach him to
restrain his passions, and to govern himself.</q>

<q>And He gave some, <hi rend='italic'>apostles</hi>;

by the same Spirit; to another the <hi rend='italic'>working of miracles</hi>; to

gifts?

11. Were the gifts of the Spirit to continue forever?
</p>

<p>
<q>Whether there be prophecies, <hi rend='italic'>they shall be done away</hi>;
whether there be tongues, <hi rend='italic'>they shall cease</hi>; whether there be
knowledge, <hi rend='italic'>it shall be done away</hi>.</q> 1 Cor. 13:8, R. V.
</p>

<p>
12. When will the gifts of the Spirit be no longer needed?

the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto Him ye

18. What was foretold through the prophet Joel?

my Spirit upon all flesh; <hi rend='italic'>and your sons and your daughters shall
prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall
see visions</hi>.</q> Joel 2:28.
</p>

<p>
19. When did this prediction begin to be fulfilled?
</p>

<p>
<q>But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;
And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour
out of My Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters
shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and
your old men shall dream dreams.</q> Acts 2:16, 17.
</p>

<p>
20. What were some of the gifts Christ gave to His church?
</p>

<p>
<q>When He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive,
and gave gifts unto men.... And He gave some, <hi rend='italic'>apostles</hi>;
and some, <hi rend='italic'>prophets</hi>; and some,
<hi rend='italic'>evangelists</hi>; and some, <hi rend='italic'>pastors</hi> and
<hi rend='italic'>teachers</hi>.</q> Eph. 4:8-11.
</p>

<p>
21. By what means did God deliver and preserve Israel?
</p>

<hi rend='italic'>by a prophet</hi> was he preserved.</q> Hosea 12:13.
</p>

<p>
22. When Moses complained of his slowness of speech, what
did God say Aaron should be to him?
</p>

<pb n='193'/><anchor id='Pg193'/>

<p>
<q>And he shall be thy <hi rend='italic'>spokesman</hi> unto the people: and he
shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a <hi rend='italic'>mouth</hi>, and thou
shalt be to him instead of God.</q> Ex. 4:16.
</p>

<p>
23. What did God afterward call Aaron?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Lord said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a
god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be <hi rend='italic'>thy prophet</hi>.</q>
Ex. 7:1.
</p>

<p>
24. What is one test by which to detect false prophets?
</p>

<p>
<q>When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, <hi rend='italic'>if the
thing follow not, nor come to pass</hi>, that is the thing which the Lord
hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously:
thou shalt not be afraid of him.</q> Deut. 18:22.
</p>

<p>
25. What other test should be applied in determining the
validity of the claims of a prophet?
</p>

<p>
<q>If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams,
and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder
come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, <hi rend='italic'>Let us go after
other gods</hi>, which thou hast not known, and <hi rend='italic'>let us serve them</hi>;
thou shalt not harken unto the words of that prophet, or that
dreamer of dreams: for the Lord your God proveth you, to know
whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with
all your soul. <hi rend='italic'>Ye shall walk after the Lord your God, and fear
Him, and keep His commandments, and obey His voice</hi>, and ye
shall serve Him, and cleave unto Him.</q> Deut. 13:1-4.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;From these
scriptures it will be seen that, in the first place,
if a prophet's words do not prove to be true, it is evidence that God has not
sent that prophet. On the other hand, even though the thing predicted
comes to pass, if the pretended prophet seeks to lead others to break God's
commandments, this, regardless of all signs, should be positive evidence
that he is not a true prophet.
</quote>

<p>
26. What rule did Christ give for distinguishing between
true and false prophets?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>By their fruits</hi> ye shall know them.</q> Matt. 7:20.
</p>

<p>
27. What general rule is laid down for testing all prophets?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>To the law and to the testimony</hi>: if they speak not according
to this word, it is because there is no light in them.</q> Isa. 8:20.
</p>

<p>
28. How did God's prophets anciently use the words of former
prophets in exhorting the people to obedience?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Should ye not hear the words which the Lord hath cried by the
former prophets</hi>, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity?</q>
Zech. 7:7.
</p>

<pb n='194'/><anchor id='Pg194'/>

<p>
29. What is the promised result of believing God's prophets?
</p>

<p>
<q>Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established;
<hi rend='italic'>believe His prophets, so shall ye prosper</hi>.</q> 2 Chron. 20:20.
</p>

<p>
30. What admonition is given regarding the gift of prophecy?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Despise not prophesyings.</hi> Prove all things; hold fast that
which is good.</q> 1 Thess. 5:20, 21.
</p>

<p>
31. What will characterize the last, or remnant, church?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to
make war with the remnant of her seed, <hi rend='italic'>which keep the commandments
of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ</hi>.</q> Rev.
12:17.
</p>

<p>
32. What is the <q>testimony of Jesus</q>?
</p>

<p>
<q>The testimony of Jesus is <hi rend='italic'>the spirit of prophecy</hi>.</q> Rev.
19:10. See Rev. 1:9.
</p>

<p>
33. What results when this gift is absent?
</p>

<p>
<q>Where there is no vision, <hi rend='italic'>the people perish</hi>: but he that
keepeth the law, happy is he.</q> Prov. 29:18. See also Ps.
74:9.

1. For what did Christ, just before His ascension, tell His

<q>And, behold, I send the promise of My Father upon you:
but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, <hi rend='italic'>until ye be endued with

</p>

<p>
2. With what did He say they would be baptized?
</p>

<p>
<q>Ye shall be baptized <hi rend='italic'>with the Holy Ghost</hi> not many days
hence.</q> Acts 1:5.
</p>

gospel under the outpouring of the Spirit?
</p>

<pb n='196'/><anchor id='Pg196'/>

<p>
<q>Now when they heard this, <hi rend='italic'>they were pricked in their heart</hi>,
and said ... Men and brethren, what shall we do?
Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one
of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and
ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.... Then they
that gladly received his word were baptized: <hi rend='italic'>and the same day
there were added unto them about three thousand souls</hi>.</q> Acts
2:37-41. <q>And by the hands of the apostles were many signs
and wonders wrought among the people; ... <hi rend='italic'>and believers
were the more added to the Lord</hi>, multitudes both of men and
women.</q> Acts 5:12-14. <q>And the word of God increased;
and <hi rend='italic'>the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly</hi>;
and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</q>
Acts 6:7.
</p>

<p>
5. How did persecution affect the preaching of the gospel?
</p>

<p>
<q>And at that time there was a great persecution against the
church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered
abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the
apostles.... <hi rend='italic'>Therefore they that were scattered abroad went
everywhere preaching the word.</hi></q> Acts 8:1-4.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;<q>Persecution has
only had a tendency to extend and establish

8. What prophecy was fulfilled in the Pentecostal outpouring

</p>

<p>
<q>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice,
<pb n='197'/><anchor id='Pg197'/>
and said, ... These are not drunken, as ye suppose,
... but <hi rend='italic'>this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel</hi>;
And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour
out My Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters
shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your
old men shall dream dreams: and on my servants and on my
handmaidens I will pour out in those days of My Spirit, and they
shall prophesy.</q> Acts 2:14-18. See Joel 2:28, 29.
</p>

<p>
9. What expressions in the prophecy of Joel seem to imply
a double fulfilment of this outpouring of the Spirit?
</p>

<p>
<q>Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord
your God: for He hath given you the <hi rend='italic'>former rain</hi> moderately,
and He will cause to come down for you the rain, the <hi rend='italic'>former
rain</hi>, and the <hi rend='italic'>latter rain</hi>
in the first month.</q> Joel 2:23. See
also Hosea 6:3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In Palestine
the early rains prepare the soil for the seed
sowing, and the latter rains ripen the grain for the harvest. So the early
outpouring of the Spirit prepared the world for the extensive sowing of the
gospel seed, and the final outpouring will come to ripen the golden grain
for the harvest of the earth, which Christ says is <q>the end of the world.</q>
Matt. 13:37-39; Rev. 14:14, 15.
</quote>

<p>
10. For what are we told to pray at this time?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain</hi>; so the
Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain,
to every one grass in the field.</q> Zech. 10:1.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Before the apostles
received the baptism of the Spirit in the
early rain on the day of Pentecost, they all <q>continued with one accord in
prayer and supplication.</q> Acts 1:14. During this time they confessed
their faults, put away their differences, ceased their selfish ambitions and
contentions for place and power, so that when the time for the outpouring
came, <q>they were all <emph>with one accord</emph> in one place,</q> ready for its
reception. To be prepared for the final outpouring of the Spirit, all sin and selfish
ambition must again be put away, and a like work of grace wrought upon
the hearts of God's people.

<p>
11. How is the closing work of the gospel under the outpouring

<q>After these things I saw another angel come down from
heaven, having great power; and <hi rend='italic'>the earth was lightened with
his glory</hi>.</q> Rev. 18:1.

12. What does this angel say?

<p>
<q>And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, <hi rend='italic'>Babylon
the great is fallen, is fallen</hi>, and is become the habitation of devils,
and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and

<p>
<q>And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, <hi rend='italic'>Come out

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;A great work
will be accomplished in a short time under
the final outpouring of the Spirit. Many voices all over the earth will
sound the warning cry. Signs and wonders will be wrought by the believers,
and, as at Pentecost, thousands will be converted in a day.
</p>

<p>
Those who fail to heed this final gospel call, like the unbelieving
Jews, will be doomed to destruction. The seven last plagues will overtake
them, as war, famine, death, and destruction overtook the Jews, who,
not believing in Christ, failed to heed His call to flee, and shut themselves
up in Jerusalem to their doom. Those who heed the call, and separate
themselves from sin and from sinners, will be saved.

<p>
1. Why were the Sacred Writings given?
</p>

<p>
<q>For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written
<hi rend='italic'>for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the
Scriptures might have hope</hi>.</q> Rom. 15:4.
</p>

<p>
2. By what means is all scripture given?
</p>

<p>
<q>All scripture is given <hi rend='italic'>by inspiration of God</hi>.</q> 2 Tim 3:16,
first part.
</p>

<p>
3. For what is it profitable?
</p>

<p>
<q>And is profitable for <hi rend='italic'>doctrine</hi>,
for <hi rend='italic'>reproof</hi>, for <hi rend='italic'>correction</hi>,
for <hi rend='italic'>instruction in righteousness</hi>.</q> Same verse, last part.
</p>

<p>
4. How was the prophecy given?
</p>

<p>
<q>For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man:
but <hi rend='italic'>holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost</hi>.</q>
2 Peter 1:21.
</p>

<p>
5. What is the Lord able to do regarding the future?
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things
do I declare: <hi rend='italic'>before they spring forth I tell you of them</hi>.</q> Isa.

6. How far-reaching is God's ability to reveal the future?
</p>

<q>Remember the former things of old: for I am God, ...
and there is none like Me, <hi rend='italic'>declaring the end from the beginning</hi>,

46:9, 10.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;In contrast
with this, note the following confession of a noted
modern historian as to man's inability to reveal the future:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>History has yet made so slight progress toward the scientific basis
that she is able to foretell nothing that is to be hereafter. As to the future,
she is stone-blind. There is not a philosopher in the world who can forecast
the historical evolution to the extent of a single day. The historian
is as completely dumb before the problems of 1895 as a charlatan weather-prophet
ought to be with respect to the meteorological conditions of the
next season. The year will come and go. It will fulfil its purpose in the
great calendar of man-life. Its events and issues will be evolved with
scientific exactitude out of antecedent conditions. But no man living can
predict what the aspect and event will be. The tallest son of the morning
can neither foretell nor foresee the nature of what is to come in the year
that already stands knocking at the door.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>John Clark
Ridpath, in Christian at Work, Dec. 27, 1894.</hi>
</p>

<p>
Knowing all things, the future is present with God. More, perhaps,
than any other one thing, the prophecies of the Bible and their fulfilment
bear witness to its divine inspiration.
</p>
</quote>

<p>
7. To whom does God reveal the secrets of the future?
</p>

<p>
<q>Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but He revealeth
His secret unto His servants <hi rend='italic'>the prophets</hi>.</q> Amos 3:7.
</p>

<p>
8. To whom do the things which have been revealed belong?
</p>

<p>
<q>The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those
things which are revealed belong <hi rend='italic'>unto us and to our children
forever</hi>.</q> Deut. 29:29.
</p>

<p>
9. What testimony did the apostle Peter bear concerning
his experience on the mount of transfiguration?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables</hi>, when we
made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ, <hi rend='italic'>but were eye-witnesses of His majesty</hi>.</q> 2 Peter 1:16.
</p>

<p>
10. When did he say he saw the majesty of Christ, and
heard the voice from heaven?
</p>

<p>
<q>And this voice which came from heaven we heard, <hi rend='italic'>when
we were with Him in the holy mount</hi>.</q> Verse 18.
</p>

<p>
11. How does he emphasize the reliability of prophecy?
</p>

<p>
<q>And we have the word of prophecy <hi rend='italic'>made more sure</hi>.</q>

13. What has ever been the theme of God's prophets?
</p>

<p>
<q>Receiving the end of your faith, even <hi rend='italic'>the salvation of your

which was in them</hi> did signify, when it testified beforehand the
sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.</q> Verse 11.

15. In what prophecy did Christ recognize Daniel as a
prophet?

in the holy place, (<hi rend='italic'>whoso

to be sealed?

<p>
17. What assurance was given by the angel that these
prophecies would be understood in the last days?
</p>

<p>
<q>And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed
up and sealed till the time of the end. Many shall be purified,

and none of the wicked shall understand; <hi rend='italic'>but the wise shall

    <head>Daniel Interpreting The Dream.
"There is a God in heaven that revealeth
secrets." Dan. 2:28.</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
1. What statement did Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,
make to his wise men whom he had assembled?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the king said unto them, <hi rend='italic'>I have dreamed a dream, and
my spirit was troubled to know the dream</hi>.</q> Dan. 2:3.
</p>

<p>
2. After being threatened with death if they did not make
known the dream and the interpretation, what did the wise men
say to the king?
</p>

<p>
<q>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, <hi rend='italic'>There is
not a man upon the earth that can show the king's matter</hi>: therefore
there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at
any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. And it is a rare
thing that the king requireth, and <hi rend='italic'>there is none other that can
show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with
flesh</hi>.</q> Verses 10, 11.
</p>

<p>
3. After the wise men had thus confessed their inability to
do what the king required, who offered to interpret the dream?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then <hi rend='italic'>Daniel</hi> went in, and desired of the king that he would
give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation.</q>
Verse 16.
</p>

<p>
4. After Daniel and his fellows had sought God earnestly,
<pb n='205'/><anchor id='Pg205'/>
how were the dream and its interpretation revealed to Daniel?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel <hi rend='italic'>in a night-vision</hi>.
Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</q> Verse 19.
</p>

<p>
5. When brought before the king, what did Daniel say?
</p>

<p>
<q>Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said,
The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men,
the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, show unto the
king; but <hi rend='italic'>there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets</hi>, and
maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter
days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed,
are these.</q> Verses 27, 28.
</p>

<p>
6. What did Daniel say the king had seen in his dream?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are
these; ... Thou, O king, sawest, and behold <hi rend='italic'>a great image</hi>.
This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before
thee; and the form thereof was terrible.</q> Verses 28-31.
</p>

<p>
7. Of what were the different parts of the image composed?
</p>

<p>
<q>This image's head was of fine <hi rend='italic'>gold</hi>, his breast and his arms
of <hi rend='italic'>silver</hi>, his belly and his thighs of
<hi rend='italic'>brass</hi>, his legs of <hi rend='italic'>iron</hi>, his
feet <hi rend='italic'>part of iron and part of clay</hi>.</q> Verses 32, 33.
</p>

<p>
8. By what means was the image broken to pieces?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou sawest till that <hi rend='italic'>a stone</hi> was cut out without hands,
which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay,
and brake them to pieces.</q> Verse 34.
</p>

<p>
9. What became of the various parts of the image?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the
gold, broken to pieces together, and <hi rend='italic'>became like the chaff of the
summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away</hi>, that
no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image
became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</q> Verse 35.
</p>

<p>
10. With what words did Daniel begin the interpretation
of the dream?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven
hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.
And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the
field and the fowls of the heaven hath He given into thine hand,
and hath made thee ruler over them all. <hi rend='italic'>Thou art this head of
gold.</hi></q> Verses 37, 38.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The character of
the Babylonian Empire is fittingly indicated
by the nature of the material composing that portion of the image by which
<pb n='206'/><anchor id='Pg206'/>
it was symbolized&mdash;the head of gold. It was <q>the golden kingdom of a
golden age.</q> The city of Babylon, its metropolis, according to history
towered to a height never equaled by any of its later rivals. <q>Situated
in the garden of the East; laid put in a perfect square sixty miles in circumference,
fifteen miles on each side, surrounded by a wall three hundred and
fifty feet high and eighty-seven feet thick, with a moat, or ditch, around
this, of equal cubic capacity with the wall itself; divided into six hundred
and seventy-six squares, laid out in luxuriant pleasure-grounds and gardens,
interspersed with magnificent dwellings,&mdash;this city, containing in
itself many things which were themselves wonders of the world, was itself
another and still mightier wonder.... Such was Babylon, with
Nebuchadnezzar, youthful, bold, vigorous, and accomplished, seated upon
its throne.</q>

<p>
<q>The breast and arms of silver.</q> Dan. 2:32.
</p>

<p>

as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron
that breaketh all these, <hi rend='italic'>shall it break in pieces and bruise</hi>.</q>

ocean; and the images of <emph>gold</emph>, or <emph>silver</emph>,

tried to reunite the broken fragments of the Roman Empire, but failed.
By marriage and intermarriage ties have been formed with a view to
strengthening and cementing together the shattered kingdom; but none
have succeeded. The element of disunion remains. Many political
revolutions and territorial changes have occurred in Europe since the fall
of the Roman Empire in 476 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>; but its divided state
still remains.

<p>
This remarkable dream, as interpreted by Daniel, presents in the
briefest form, and yet with unmistakable clearness, the course of world
empires from the time of Nebuchadnezzar to the close of earthly history
and the setting up of the everlasting kingdom of God. The history confirms
the prophecy. The sovereignty of the world was held by Babylon
from the time of this dream, <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi> 603,
until <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi> 538, when it passed to
the Medes and Persians. The victory of the Grecian forces at the battle
of Arbela, in <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi> 331,
marked the downfall of the Medo-Persian Empire,
and the Greeks then became the undisputed rulers of the world. The
battle of Pydna, in Macedonia, in <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi>
168, was the last organized effort
to withstand a world-wide conquest by the Romans, and at that time
therefore the sovereignty passed from the Greeks to the Romans, and the
fourth kingdom was fully established. The division of Rome into ten
kingdoms is definitely foretold in the vision recorded in the seventh chapter
of Daniel, and occurred between the years 351
<hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> and 476 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>
</p>

<pb n='208'/><anchor id='Pg208'/>

<p>
21. What is to take place in the days of these kingdoms?
</p>

<p>
<q>And in the days of these kings shall <hi rend='italic'>the God of heaven set
up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed</hi>: ... but it
shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it
shall stand forever.</q> Verse 44.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This verse
foretells the establishment of another universal
kingdom, the kingdom of God. This kingdom is to overthrow and supplant
all existing earthly kingdoms, and is to stand forever. The time
for the setting up of this kingdom was to be <q>in the days of these kings.</q>
This cannot refer to the four preceding empires, or kingdoms; for they
were not contemporaneous, but successive; neither can it refer to an establishment
of the kingdom at Christ's first advent, for the ten kingdoms which
arose out of the ruins of the Roman Empire were not yet in existence.
It must therefore be yet future.

<p>
1. What gospel did Jesus preach?
</p>

<p>
<q>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues,
and preaching <hi rend='italic'>the gospel of the kingdom</hi>.</q> Matt. 4:23.
</p>

<p>
2. How extensively did He say this should be preached?
</p>

<p>
<q>And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached <hi rend='italic'>in all the
world</hi> for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end
come.</q> Matt. 24:14.
</p>

<p>
3. What shows that it has always been God's purpose that
all the world should hear the gospel?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy
country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house,
unto a land that I will show thee: and I will make of thee a great
nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou
shalt be a blessing: and <hi rend='italic'>in thee shall all families of the earth be
blessed</hi>.</q> Gen. 12:1-3. <q>And the Scripture, <hi rend='italic'>foreseeing that
God would justify the heathen through faith</hi>, preached before the
gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be
blessed.</q> Gal. 3:8.
</p>

<p>
4. How did God warn Israel against formalism?
</p>

<p>
<q>Forasmuch as this people draw near Me with their <hi rend='italic'>mouth</hi>,
and with their <hi rend='italic'>lips</hi> do honor Me, but have removed their heart
far from Me, and their fear toward Me is taught by the precept
of men: therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous
work among this people: ... for the wisdom of their wise
men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men
shall be hid.</q> Isa. 29:13, 14.
</p>

<pb n='210'/><anchor id='Pg210'/>

<p>
5. What shows that they had substituted the ritual service
of the temple for heart service?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thus saith the Lord, ... Amend your ways and
your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. <hi rend='italic'>Trust
ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord, The temple
of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, are these.</hi></q> Jer. 7:3, 4.
</p>

<p>
6. What national disaster did they bring upon themselves
by their apostasy from God?
</p>

<p>
<q>So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold,
they were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah,
<hi rend='italic'>who were carried away to Babylon for their transgression</hi>.</q> 1
Chron. 9:1.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;From the earliest times
it has been God's purpose that those
who receive the gospel should make it known to others. For this purpose
He chose a special people and established them in Palestine, in the highway
of the nations; but they shut up the revelation of the truth to themselves,
and so lost it. A few, like Daniel and his companions, maintained
a personal connection with God, although surrounded by spiritual declension
and dry formalism, and so were chosen by God to carry out His plan
that the gospel of the kingdom should be preached in Babylon. They were
tested and trained in Babylon, as shown in the first chapter of Daniel, and
then, being ready to make known the gospel, the way providentially opened
for them by the dream of Nebuchadnezzar.
</quote>

<p>
7. In interpreting Nebuchadnezzar's dream, what kingdom
did Daniel say would follow the four world empires?
</p>

<p>
<q>And in the days of these kings shall <hi rend='italic'>the God of heaven set
up a kingdom</hi>, which shall never be destroyed.</q> Dan. 2:44.
</p>

<p>
8. What was this kingdom to do to the other kingdoms?
</p>

<p>
<q>The kingdom shall not be left to other people, but <hi rend='italic'>it shall
break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms</hi>.</q> Same verse.
</p>

<p>
9. How long is this kingdom to continue?
</p>

<p>
<q>And it shall <hi rend='italic'>stand forever</hi>.</q> Same verse, last clause.
</p>

<p>
10. What words of Christ imply the gospel's final triumph?
</p>

<p>
<q>And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon
this rock I will build My church; and <hi rend='italic'>the gates of hell shall not
prevail against it</hi>.</q> Matt. 16:18.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Anciently the
gates to cities were places for holding courts,
transacting business, and deliberating on public matters. The word gates,
therefore, is used for counsels, designs, machinations, and evil purposes.
The gates of hell mean the plottings, stratagems, and designs of Satan to
overthrow the church. But none of these are to prevail.
</quote>

<p>
11. What promises to David will thus be fulfilled?
</p>

<pb n='211'/><anchor id='Pg211'/>

<p>
<q>Thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever:
... thy throne shall be established forever.</q> 2 Sam. 7:16.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;By uniting His divinity
with humanity in becoming the Son
of David, Christ laid the foundation upon which He built His church, and
thus established the house of David forever. The kingdom of God, the
house of David, and the church of Christ are so inseparably connected in
this prophecy that the establishment of either involves the establishment
of the other two.
</quote>

<p>
12. Through whom are these promises to be fulfilled?
</p>

<p>
<q>He shall be great, and shall be called <hi rend='italic'>the Son of the Highest</hi>:
and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father
David: and He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and
of His kingdom there shall be no end.</q> Luke 1:32, 33.
</p>

<p>
13. In order to fulfil these promises, whose son did the Son
of God become?
</p>

<p>
<q>The son of <hi rend='italic'>David</hi>.</q> Matt. 22:42.
</p>

<p>
14. What is this union of divinity and humanity called?
</p>

<p>
<q>And without controversy great is <hi rend='italic'>the mystery of godliness</hi>:
God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of
angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world,
received up into glory.</q> 1 Tim. 3:16.
</p>

<p>
15. What did Jesus call this same mystery?
</p>

<p>
<q>And He said unto them, Unto you it is given to know <hi rend='italic'>the
mystery of the kingdom of God</hi>: but unto them that are without,
all these things are done in parables.</q> Mark 4:11.
</p>

<p>
16. In what confession did the wise men of Babylon deny
any knowledge of this essential doctrine of Christianity?
</p>

<p>
<q>And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is
none other that can show it before the king, except <hi rend='italic'>the gods,
whose dwelling is not with flesh</hi>.</q> Dan. 2:11.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The union
of the divine and human in the person of Christ
is <q>the mystery of godliness,</q> or <q>the mystery of the kingdom of God.</q>
In the case of the seed which is sown in the field, this same principle is
illustrated by the union of the reproducing power with the material form.
As the seed is thus capable of multiplying itself, so Christ reproduces His
own character in believers, by making them partakers of the divine nature.
At His coming He bestows upon the subjects of the kingdom the gift of
immortality (1 Cor. 15:51-53), and so the kingdom will stand forever.
It is quite likely that the wise men of Babylon did not understand about
the incarnation of God in the flesh in the coming Messiah, but in their
statement that the dwelling of the gods was not with flesh they announced
the fundamental error of Babylon, both ancient and modern, and really
denied the vital principle of Christianity. This was the essential secret,
or mystery, of the kingdom of God, which needed to be known in Babylon,
and which is still to be proclaimed throughout the world.

<pb n='212'/><anchor id='Pg212'/>

<p>
17. Concerning what did Daniel and his companions pray?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known
to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: that they would desire
mercies of the God of heaven <hi rend='italic'>concerning this secret</hi>.</q>
Verses 17, 18.
</p>

<p>
18. What would have been the result of failure on their
part to obtain a knowledge of this mystery?
</p>

<p>
<q>That Daniel and his fellows should not <hi rend='italic'>perish with the rest
of the wise men of Babylon</hi>.</q> Verse 18, last part.
</p>

<p>
19. How was the secret concerning the king's dream revealed,
and thus the mystery of the kingdom of God made
known in Babylon?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel <hi rend='italic'>in a night-vision</hi>.
Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</q> Verse 19.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The most
vital truth of the gospel of the kingdom of God was
denied in the religion of Babylon. This made it necessary that this very
truth should be preached in Babylon. This mystery of the kingdom of
God was the real and essential secret which the wise men of Babylon could
not make known to the king, and which could be learned only by revelation.
This is the mystery which <q>from the beginning of the world hath
been hid in God</q> (Eph. 3:9); and the <q>riches of the glory of this mystery</q>
is <q>Christ in you, the hope of glory</q> (Col. 1:27), or <q>the mystery of the
gospel</q> (Eph. 6:19).
</quote>

<p>
20. How did Nebuchadnezzar acknowledge God as the revealer,
and thus Daniel's intimate fellowship with Him?
</p>

<p>
<q>The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is,
that <hi rend='italic'>your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer
of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret</hi>.</q> Verse 47.
</p>

<p>
21. When the gospel of the kingdom has been fully preached,
and Christ appears as King, what invitation will be extended
to those who have learned <q>the mystery of the kingdom</q>?
</p>

<p>
<q>When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the
holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His
glory: and before Him shall be gathered all nations....
Then shall the King say unto them on His right hand, <hi rend='italic'>Come,
ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world</hi>.</q> Matt. 25:31-34.

1. At what time was Daniel's second vision given?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon</hi> Daniel had a
dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the
dream, and told the sum of the matters.</q> Dan. 7:1.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;That is, in the

<p>
2. What effect did this dream have upon Daniel?
</p>

<p>
<q>I Daniel was <hi rend='italic'>grieved in my spirit</hi> in the midst of my body,
and the visions of my head <hi rend='italic'>troubled me</hi>.</q> Verse 15.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The effect of
Daniel's dream upon him, it will be noticed,
was similar to the effect of Nebuchadnezzar's dreams upon him; it troubled
him. See Dan. 2:1.

</p>

<p>
<q>I came near unto one of them that stood by, <hi rend='italic'>and asked him

<p>
4. What did the prophet see in this vision?

6. What did these four beasts represent?
</p>

<p>
<q>These great beasts, which are four, are <hi rend='italic'>four kings, which
shall arise out of the earth</hi>.</q> Verse 17.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The word kings here,
as in Dan. 2:44, denotes kingdoms, as
explained in verses 23 and 24 of the seventh chapter, the two words being
used interchangeably in this prophecy.
</quote>

<p>
7. In symbolic language, what is represented by winds?
</p>

<p>
Strife, war, commotion. See Jer. 25:31-33; 49:36, 37.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;That winds denote
strife and war is evident from the vision
itself. As a result of the striving of the winds, kingdoms rise and fall.
</quote>

<p>
8. What, in prophecy, is symbolized by waters?
</p>

<p>
<q>And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest
... are <hi rend='italic'>peoples</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>multitudes</hi>,
and <hi rend='italic'>nations</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>tongues</hi>.</q>
Rev. 17:15.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In the second
chapter of Daniel, under the figure of an image
of man, the mere political outline of the rise and fall of earthly kingdoms is
given, preceding the setting up of God's everlasting kingdom. In the
seventh chapter, earthly governments, are represented as viewed in the
light of Heaven,&mdash;under the symbols of wild and ferocious beasts,&mdash;the
last, in particular, oppressing and persecuting the saints of the Most High.
Hence the change in the symbols used to represent these kingdoms.
</quote>

<p>
9. What was the first beast like?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>The first was like a lion</hi>, and had eagle's wings: I beheld
till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the
earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's
heart was given to it.</q> Dan. 7:4.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The lion, the first
of these four great beasts, like the golden
head of Nebuchadnezzar's dream, represents the Babylonian monarchy;
the lion, the king of beasts, standing at the head of his kind, as gold does of
metals. The eagle's wings doubtless denote the rapidity with which Babylon
extended its conquests under Nebuchadnezzar, who reigned from
<hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi> 604 to <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi> 561.
This kingdom was overthrown by the Medes and Persians

10. By what was the second kingdom symbolized?
</p>

<p>
<q>And behold another beast, <hi rend='italic'>a second, like to a bear</hi>, and it
raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of
it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise,
devour much flesh.</q> Verse 5.

<p>
11. By what was the third universal empire symbolized?
</p>

<p>
<q>After this I beheld, and lo another, <hi rend='italic'>like a leopard</hi>, which
<pb n='216'/><anchor id='Pg216'/>
had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also
four heads; and dominion was given to it.</q> Verse 6.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;If the wings
of an eagle on the back of a lion denoted rapidity
of movement in the Babylonian, or Assyrian, Empire (see Hab. 1:6-8),
four wings on the leopard must denote unparalleled celerity of movement
in the Grecian Empire. This we find to be historically true.
</p>

<p>
<q>The rapidity of Alexander's conquests in Asia was marvelous: he
burst like a torrent on the expiring Persian Empire, and all opposition was
useless. The gigantic armies collected to oppose him melted like snow in
the sunshine. The battles of Granicus, <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi> 334, Issus in the
following year, and Arbela in <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi> 331, settled the fate of
the Persian Empire, and established
the wide dominion of the Greeks.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>The Divine Program of the

</p>

<p>
<q>The beast had also four heads.</q> The Grecian Empire maintained
its unity but a short time after the death of Alexander, which occurred
in <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi> 323. Within twenty-two years after the close of his
brilliant career, or by <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi> 301, the empire was divided among
his four leading generals.
Cassander took Macedonia and Greece in the west; Lysimachus had Thrace
and the parts of Asia on the Hellespont and Bosporus in the north; Ptolemy
received Egypt, Lydia, Arabia, Palestine, and Cœle-Syria in the south;
and Seleucus had all the rest of Alexander's dominions in the east.

<p>
12. How was the fourth kingdom represented?
</p>

<p>
<q>After, this I saw in the night-visions, and behold <hi rend='italic'>a fourth

great iron teeth</hi>: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped
the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the
beasts that were before it; <hi rend='italic'>and it had ten horns</hi>.</q> Verse 7.

</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;The Roman Empire

<p>
<q rend='pre'>The historian Machiavelli, without the slightest reference to this

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;<q>The little
horn, further, shall think to change times. The
description applies, in all its force, to the systematic perversion of God's
words by which all promises of millennial glory are wrested from their true
sense, and referred to the dominion and grandeur of the Church of Rome.
The orator of the Pope, for instance, in the Lateran Council, declares that
in the submission of all nations to Leo the prophecy was fulfilled: <q>All kings
shall fall down and worship Him; all nations shall serve and obey Him.</q>
The same antichristian feature appears in those advocates of the Papacy

that church from which the idols are utterly abolished.</q> Thus are the times

<p>
Although the ten commandments, the law of God, are found in the
Roman Catholic versions of the Scriptures, as they were originally given,
yet the faithful are instructed from the catechisms of the church, and not
directly from the Bible. As it appears in these, the law of God has been
changed and virtually reenacted by the Papacy. Furthermore, communicants
not only receive the law from the church, but they deal with the
church concerning any alleged infractions of that law, and when they have
satisfied the ecclesiastical authorities, the whole matter is settled.
</p>

<p>
The second commandment, which forbids the making of, and bowing
down to, images, is omitted in Catholic catechisms, and the tenth, which
forbids coveting, is divided into two.
</p>

<p>
As evidence of the change which has been made in the law of God by
the papal power, and that it acknowledges the change and claims the authority
to make it, note the following from Roman Catholic publications:&mdash;
</p>

<pb n='222'/><anchor id='Pg222'/>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='italic'>Question.</hi>&mdash;Have you
any other way of proving that the church has

</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Answer.</hi>&mdash;Had she
not such power, she could not have done that in
which all modern religionists agree with her,&mdash;she could not have substituted
the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance
of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no
Scriptural authority.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>A

</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='italic'>Ques.</hi>&mdash;How prove you that the church hath
power to command feasts and holy days?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='italic'>Ans.</hi>&mdash;By the
very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which
Protestants allow of; and therefore they fondly contradict themselves,
by keeping Sunday strictly, and breaking most other feasts commanded
by the same church.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'><hi rend='italic'>Ques.</hi>&mdash;How prove you that?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Ans.</hi>&mdash;Because by
keeping Sunday they acknowledge the church's
power to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin: and by not keeping
the rest by her commanded, they deny again, in fact, the
same power.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>An

</p>

<p>
<q>Is not every Christian obliged to sanctify Sunday, to abstain on that
day from unnecessary servile work? Is not the observance of this law
among the most prominent of our sacred duties? But you may read the
Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing
the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the religious
observance of Saturday, a day which we never
sanctify.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>The Faith of

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;A time in
prophecy being the same as a year (see Dan. 11:13,
margin, and R. V.), three and one-half times would be three and a half
years, or forty-two months, or twelve hundred and sixty days, since the
calendar year of 360 days, or twelve months of thirty days each, is used in
prophetic chronology. As each day represents a year, the period, the end
of which was to mark the limit of the time of the supremacy of the little
horn, the Papacy, over the saints, times, and the law, would therefore
be twelve hundred and sixty years.

The decree of the emperor Justinian, issued in
<hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> 533, recognized the
Pope as <q>head of all the holy churches.</q> (Justinian's Code, book 1, title
1. Baronius's Annals, <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> 533.)
The overwhelming defeat of the Ostrogoths
in the siege of Rome, five years later, <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>
538, was a death-blow to
the independence of the Arian power then ruling Italy, and was therefore
a notable date in the development of papal supremacy. With the period
533-538, then, commences the twelve hundred and sixty years of this
prophecy, which would extend to the period 1793-1798. The year 1793
was the year of the Reign of Terror in the French Revolution, and the
year when the Roman Catholic religion was set aside in France and the
worship of reason was established in its stead. As a direct result of the
revolt against papal authority in the French Revolution, the French army,
under Berthier, entered Rome, and the Pope was taken prisoner Feb. 10,
1798, dying in exile at Valence, France, the following year. This period,
1793-1798, during which this death-stroke was inflicted upon the Papacy,
fittingly and clearly marks the close of the long prophetic period mentioned
in this prophecy. Any standard history of the time may be consulted in
substantiation of the facts here stated.

features of this outline. The exact fulfilment of this outline in the
history of the world since the time of Nebuchadnezzar constitutes an unimpeachable
testimony to the inspiration of these prophecies, and furnishes
a ground of confidence that the unfulfilled portion of the prophecies
will be wrought out in the future with absolute certainty and in every

<p>
10. Who was represented by <q>the great horn,</q> and what

<p>
<q>And the rough goat is the king [kingdom] of Grecia: and
the great horn that is between his eyes is <hi rend='italic'>the first king</hi>. Now
that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, <hi rend='italic'>four kingdoms

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;From
the interpretation given, it is plain that the notable
<q>horn</q> upon the he goat represented Alexander the Great, who led the
Grecian forces in their conquest of Medo-Persia. Upon the death of
Alexander at Babylon, <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi> 323, there followed a brief period
of confusion in the struggle for the kingdom, but the succession was definitely determined
by the battle of Ipsus, <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi> 301. Alexander's four leading
generals&mdash;Cassander,
Lysimachus, Ptolemy, and Seleucus&mdash;became his successors.
</p>

<p>
<q>The vast empire created by Alexander's unparalleled conquests was
distracted by the wranglings and wars of his successors, and before the
close of the fourth century before Christ, had become broken up into many
fragments. Besides minor states, four well-defined and important monarchies
rose out of the ruins.... Their rulers were Lysimachus,
Cassander, Seleucus Nicator, and Ptolemy, who had each assumed the
title of king. The great horn was broken; and instead of it came up four
notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Myers's

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;The
interpretation already given to this vision shows plainly
that the power represented by the little horn is the successor of Medo-Persia
and Grecia. In the vision of the seventh chapter of Daniel, which
is closely related to this vision, the fourth beast represented the fourth
kingdom, or Rome, in its entirety, special attention, however, being given
to the <q>little horn</q> phase of its history. As shown by the work attributed
to it, this little horn, which arose among the ten kingdoms into which Rome
was divided, was to be a religio-political power, which was to change the
times and law of God, and persecute the people of God. In the vision of
the eighth chapter the ecclesiastical features of this fourth world power are
especially noticed and emphasized, and hence the only symbol there used
to represent it is the <q>little horn</q> which waxed <q>exceeding great.</q>
</p>

<p>
The religion of all the four great monarchies mentioned in these
prophecies was paganism; but the paganism of ancient Babylon was reproduced
in pagan Rome, and then adapted and adopted by papal Rome.
The little horn of the eighth chapter represents Rome, both pagan and
papal, in its ecclesiastical aspect, with its union of paganism, and later of
apostate Christianity, with the secular power; with its antichristian persecutions
of the saints of God; with its perversion of the priesthood of Christ;
and with its assertion of both temporal and spiritual power over all the
world. It is evident that pagan Rome is introduced into this prophecy
chiefly as a means of locating the place and work of papal Rome, and the
ecclesiastical features of pagan Rome as typical of the same features accentuated
in papal Rome, and that the emphasis is to be placed upon the
fulfilment of the prophecy in the work of papal Rome. A careful comparison
of Dan. 7:21, 25, with Dan. 8:10-12, R. V., and 2 Thess. 2:3, 4, will
amply justify this conclusion.
</p>

<p>
<q>The Romans could not forget&mdash;never did forget&mdash;that they had
once been masters and rulers of the world. Even after they had become
wholly unfit to rule themselves, let alone the ruling of others, they still
retained the temper and used the language of masters.... In the
absence of an emperor in the West the popes rapidly gained influence and
power, and soon built up an ecclesiastical empire that in some respects
took the place of the old empire and carried on its civilizing
work.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Myers's
<q>Rome; Its Rise and Fall,</q> Boston, 1900, pages 398, 399, 442, 443.</hi>
</p>

<p>
The host and the stars of Dan. 8:10 are the same as the saints of the
Most High of Dan. 7:25; and the Prince of the host of Dan. 8:11 is the
Prince of princes, or Christ. When the same being appeared to Joshua
(Joshua 5:13-15, margin), He applies the same expression to Himself.
</p>

<p>
In Dan. 8:11-13, in the Revised Version, the words <q>burnt offering</q>
have been supplied by the translators after the word <q>continual,</q> but this
rendering seems to place too restricted a meaning upon the word <q>continual.</q>
The fact that no word is connected with <q>continual</q> in the
original text, although in the typical service of the sanctuary it is used
with <q>burnt offering</q> (Ex. 29:42), with <q>incense</q> (Ex. 30:8, here rendered
perpetual), and with <q>showbread</q> (Num. 4:7), indicates that that
which is continual represents the <emph>continual service or mediation of Christ
in the heavenly sanctuary</emph>, in which all that was continual in the typical
<pb n='228'/><anchor id='Pg228'/>
service found its antitype and fulfilment. See Heb. 6:19, 20; 7:1-3, 14-16,
23-25. The action which made the Pope the vicar of God and the high
priest of the apostasy, really took away from Christ, as far as human intent
and power were concerned, his place and work as the only mediator
between God and man (1 Tim. 2:5), and this took away from Him, as far
as man could take it away, the continual mediation, according to the prediction
in this prophecy.
</p>

<p>
The prophecies of Daniel are cumulative and widening in their view,
each carrying matters farther than the preceding one, and bringing out
more explicitly and more in detail important features down the stream of
time. In Daniel 2, under the fourth universal kingdom, the Papacy is
not represented under any direct symbol or figure at all,&mdash;simply Rome in
its united and divided state; in Daniel 7 Rome is symbolized by the <q>little
horn</q> coming up among the ten horns representing the divided state of
Rome; while in Daniel 8 the only figure used to represent the fourth world
power is the <q>little horn</q> which waxed <q>exceeding great.</q>
</p>

<p>
In each of these last two chapters the little horn is introduced to tell
especially of the workings of the same terrible power&mdash;Rome papal. Both
chapters deal with the same great apostasy. In the seventh chapter, the
little horn takes away <emph>the law of God</emph>. In the eighth chapter, it takes
away <emph>the gospel</emph>. Had it taken away only the law, this would have vitiated
the gospel; for, with the law of God gone, even the <emph>true</emph> gospel could
not save, because the law is needed to convict and give a knowledge of
sin. And had the Papacy taken away only the gospel, and left the law,
salvation through such a system would still have been impossible, for there
is no salvation for sinners through even the law of God itself apart from
Christ and the gospel. But to make apostasy doubly sure, this power
changes, vitiates, and takes away both the <emph>law</emph> and the <emph>gospel.</emph>
</p>

<p>
In changing the Sabbath, the Papacy struck directly at the very heart
and seal of the law of God, just as in substituting its own mediatorial system
for that of Christ's it struck directly at the heavenly sanctuary and its
service, which, in his epistle to the Hebrews, Paul shows to be the very
heart and essence of the gospel.

the vision is clearly defined. It is <q>the
vision concerning the continual burnt offering [or continual mediation],
and the transgression that maketh desolate,</q> which results in giving both
the sanctuary and the people of God to be trodden underfoot. The time
when the vision was to have its special application is stated in verse 17
to be <q>at the time of the end,</q> or in the last days. This is additional
proof that this prophecy was to find its complete fulfilment in papal
Rome only, as pagan Rome passed away many centuries ago. The sanctuary
and the twenty-three-hundred-day period here referred to are considered
at length in succeeding readings. See pages <ref target='Pg230'>230</ref>,

</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;Inasmuch as
the taking away of the continual mediation of
Christ is made the beginning of a prophetic period, there must be some
definite act at some definite time which, in form and intent, takes from
Christ His priestly work in the heavenly sanctuary. This act was the
official decree of an ecclesiastical council held at
Rome in 503 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>, by
which it was declared <q>that the Pope was judge as God's vicar, and could
himself be judged by no one.</q> See Hardouin's <q>Councils,</q> Vol. II, page
983; Labbe and Cossart's <q>Councils,</q> Vol. IV, col. 1364; and Bower's
<q>History of the Popes</q> (three-volume edition), Vol. I, pages 304, 305.
The work of Clovis, king of the Franks, who earned for himself the title
of <q>the eldest son of the church</q> by his campaigns to subdue the kingdoms
hostile to the Papacy, contributed much toward putting into practical
effect this claim of the Papacy, which finally resulted in establishing the
Pope as the head of the Roman priesthood which has usurped the priestly
work of Christ, and has established another system of mediation in its
place. This work of Clovis came to its climax in the period 503-508, and
this period therefore becomes the natural one from which to date the 1290
years of Dan. 12:11, which would accordingly end in the period 1793-98,
at the same time as the 1260 years of Dan. 7:25. See notes on page

<p>
<q>With Rome would have fallen her bishop, had he not, as if by anticipation
of the crisis, reserved till this hour the master-stroke of his policy.
He now boldly cast himself upon an element of much greater strength than
that of which the political convulsions of the time had deprived him;
namely, that the bishop of Rome is the successor of Peter, the prince of
the apostles, and, in virtue of being so, is Christ's vicar on earth. In
making this claim, the Roman pontiffs vaulted at once over the throne of
kings to the seat of gods: Rome became once more the mistress of the
world, and her popes the rulers of the earth.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>The

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;There is
abundant evidence that the instruction in the ninth
chapter of Daniel supplements and interprets the vision of the eighth
chapter. Note the following facts:&mdash;
</p>

<pb n='232'/><anchor id='Pg232'/>

<p>
(1) Daniel did not understand the vision concerning the treading
down of his people and the sanctuary, and therefore searched the prophecies
anew concerning the period of captivity.
</p>

<p>
(2) He evidently made a connection between the period of seventy
years mentioned by Jeremiah and the twenty-three hundred days of the
vision, and he at once began to pray earnestly for the restoration of the
city and the sanctuary.
</p>

<p>
(3) The angel Gabriel, who appeared to him at the first, and interpreted
all the vision with the exception of the twenty-three hundred days,
now appears, and again directs his attention to the vision.
</p>

<p>
(4) The events of the vision begin with the kingdom of the Medes and
Persians, the era of the restoration of the Jews to their own land. In the
absence of any instruction to the contrary, this would be the natural time
in which to locate the beginning of the period of twenty-three hundred
days; and this is the very time given for the beginning of the seventy weeks,
which are clearly a part of the twenty-three hundred days, and thus determine
the time of their commencement.
</p>

<p>
(5) The seventy weeks, or four hundred and ninety years, extend from
the restoration of literal Jerusalem and the literal temple to the preaching
of the gospel to all the world. See Acts 15:14-17. This special preaching
of the gospel was completed in one generation, and was followed by the
destruction of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
(6) The twenty-three hundred prophetic days, or twenty-three hundred
literal years, begin at the same time as the four hundred and ninety
years, or seventy weeks, or in <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi>
457, when the commandment to restore
and build Jerusalem went forth; and extend from the restoration of literal
<pb n='233'/><anchor id='Pg233'/>
Jerusalem and the typical temple service after the captivity in ancient
Babylon, in the time of the Medes and Persians, to
1844 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>, the time for
the restoration of spiritual Jerusalem and of the knowledge of the mediation
of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, taken away by the little horn, after
the captivity in modern Babylon. This work of restoration is to be accomplished
in one generation by preaching the gospel to all the world (Rev.
14:6-12), and this will be followed by the destruction of the world, or fall
of all nations, of which the destruction of Jerusalem was a type.

    <head>The 2300 Days</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
The heavy line represents the full 2300 year-day period,
the longest prophetic period in the Bible. Beginning in <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi> 457
when the decree was given to restore and build Jerusalem
(Ezra 7:11-26; Dan. 9:25), seven weeks (49 years) are measured off
to indicate the time occupied in this work of restoration. These,
however, are a part of the sixty-nine weeks (483 years) that
were to reach to Messiah, the Anointed One. Christ was anointed
in 27 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>, at His baptism. Matt. 3:13-17; Acts 10:38.
In the midst of the seventieth week (31 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>),
Christ was crucified, or <q>cut off,</q> which marked the time when the sacrifices and
oblations of the earthly sanctuary were to cease. Dan. 9:26,
27. The remaining three and one-half years of this week reach
to 34 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>, or to the stoning of
Stephen, and the great persecution of the church at Jerusalem which followed. Acts 7:59;
8:1. This marked the close of the seventy weeks, or 490 years, allotted to the
Jewish people.
</p>

<p>
But the seventy weeks are a part of the 2300 days; and as
they (the seventy weeks) reach to 34 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>, the remaining
1810 years of the 2300-day period must reach to 1844, when
the work of judgment, or cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary,
was to begin. Rev. 14:6, 7. Then special light began to
shine upon the whole sanctuary subject, and Christ's mediatorial
or priestly work in it.
</p>

<p>
Four great events, therefore, are located by this great
prophetic period,&mdash;the first advent, the crucifixion, the rejection of
the Jewish people as a nation, and the beginning of the work of final judgment.

<q>There is plainly a close correspondence between the two visions of
Daniel 8 and Daniel 9. The seventy weeks are said to be <emph>cut off</emph> for certain
distinct objects; and this implies a longer period from which they are
separated, either the course of time in general, or some period distinctly
revealed. Now the previous date (the 2300 days) includes two events,&mdash;the
restoration of the sacrifice, and the desolation. The first of these is
identical in character with the seventy weeks, which are a period of the
restored polity of Jerusalem; and hence the most natural of the cutting
off is that which refers it to the whole period of the
former vision.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>First

Maximus, or high priest. Power over this truth of the gospel and
over the people of God was allowed to the Papacy because of transgression

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;Literal Jerusalem
was given into the hands of ancient Babylon,
and the typical service in the earthly sanctuary was thus taken away.
Dan. 1:1, 2. This was prophetic of the experience of spiritual Jerusalem
in modern Babylon, foretold in the prophecies of Daniel and John, and of
the taking away of the mediation of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary.
Dan. 7:25; 8:13. These two visions expose the work of modern Babylon,
the Papacy, and determine the limit of its permitted power over the people
of God, and of its perversion of the gospel of Christ in substituting another
mediatorial system for the work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary.
</p>

<p>
The general theme upon which the book of Daniel treats is Babylon,
both ancient and modern. Chapters 1-6, inclusive, present certain historical
facts leading up to the fall of ancient Babylon, and an attempt to
destroy the prophet Daniel himself and the final attempt to destroy the
people of God,&mdash;a brief historical outline, which is in itself a prophecy of
modern Babylon. Chapters 7-12, inclusive, contain prophecies relating
especially to modern Babylon, which supplement the historical prophecy
of the previous chapters, and which enable us to draw a very exact and
striking parallel between ancient and modern Babylon. A brief outline
of this parallel may be stated thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(1) In the religion of ancient Babylon, image-worship found a prominent
place. The same is true of modern Babylon.
</p>

<p>
(2) Ancient Babylon affirmed that the gods (or God) dwelt not in the
flesh. By the dogma of the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary
(that is, that she herself was born without the taint of original sin), modern
Babylon teaches that God, in the person of His Son, did not take the same
flesh with us; that is, sinful flesh.
</p>

<p>
(3) Ancient Babylon persecuted those who refused to accept her dogmas
and worship according to her laws. Modern Babylon has done the same.
</p>

<p>
(4) The king of ancient Babylon set himself above God, and attempted
to make his kingdom an everlasting kingdom. So does modern Babylon.
</p>

<p>
(5) Ancient Babylon rejected the true gospel as taught to Nebuchadnezzar,
and the fall of Babylon came in consequence. Modern Babylon
has done the same in her rejection of the true gospel as brought to her in
the Reformation, and her fall is inevitable and impending.
</p>

<p>
(6) The fall of ancient Babylon came just at the time when it was
giving expression to its contempt of all its enemies, and its confidence in its
own permanence. This experience will be repeated in the history of
modern Babylon.
</p>
</quote>

<p>
17. What prophetic period, therefore, extends to the deliverance
of God's people from the captivity in modern Babylon,
and the restoration to them of the mediation of Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>And he said unto me, <hi rend='italic'>Unto two thousand and three hundred
days</hi>; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</q> Verse 14.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The earthly
sanctuary was a type of the heavenly sanctuary
(Heb. 9:23, 24; Lev. 16:29, 30, 33); the cleansing of the earthly sanctuary
was typical of the cleansing in the heavenly sanctuary; and this cleansing
of the sanctuary accomplished on the great day of atonement is the closing
<pb n='237'/><anchor id='Pg237'/>
work of Christ in His mediation for sin. And the commencement of
the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary marks the beginning of a new era
in the experience of the people of God on earth; namely, the deliverance
from the power of modern Babylon, the restoration to them of the knowledge
of the mediation of Christ for them in the heavenly sanctuary, and a
cleansing from sin in preparation for the second advent of Christ. The
cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary involves the investigative judgment,
which will be followed by the plagues, and Christ's coming. This period,
therefore, determines the time of restoration and of judgment.
</quote>

<p>
18. What is said of those who live to see the deliverance from
modern Babylon, and the restoration of the true gospel?
</p>

<p>
<q>Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand
three hundred and five and thirty days.</q> Dan. 12:12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The 1335 days
(years) of Dan. 12:12 are evidently a continuation
of the 1290 days (years) of the previous verse, which commence
with the taking away of the mediation of Christ, in
the period 503-508 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>
See under question 22 in reading on <q>The Vicar of Christ,</q> page 229.
The 1335 days, or years, would therefore extend to the period 1838-43,
the time of the preaching of the judgment-hour, in preparation for the
cleansing of the sanctuary, and the accompanying work at the end of the
2300 days, or years, of Dan. 8:14. At that time special blessings were to
come upon those who were delivered from the errors and bondage of Rome,
and had their minds directed anew to the mediation of Christ as the great
High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>General Note on the Prophecies of Daniel.</hi>&mdash;The second
chapter of Daniel presents in brief outline the divine program of history leading
up to the establishment of the everlasting kingdom of God. The seventh
chapter of Daniel presents somewhat more in detail the history of those
earthly kingdoms which were to precede the establishment of the kingdom
of God, the objective point of the prophecy being the little horn and its
effort to change the laws and ordinances of God, and to destroy the subjects
of the heavenly kingdom. The period allotted to the supremacy of
this power, the Papacy (the 1260 years), is also indicated. The prophecy
of the eighth chapter of Daniel covers the period from the restoration
era in the time of the Persian kings and the establishment of the people
of God in their own land, to the restoration era just preceding the second
advent of Christ and the setting up of His everlasting kingdom. In this
chapter the leading theme is the effort of the Papacy to substitute its own
mediatorial system for the mediatorial work of Christ, and the announcement
of a prophetic period (the 2300 years), at the end of which the counterfeit
system introduced by the Papacy was to be fully exposed. The
remaining chapters of Daniel supplement the prophecies of the second,
seventh, and eighth chapters, and show that at the end of the first portion
of the 2300-year period (the 70 weeks, or 490 years) Messiah was to appear
and be cut off, following which would come the destruction of Jerusalem.
In the closing chapter two new periods are introduced (the 1290 years
and the 1335 years), at the end of which, as with the 2300 years, was to
come the movement preparatory to the setting up of God's everlasting
kingdom in the earth, in harmony with the prophecies of the second and
seventh chapters.

10. Who alone went into the second apartment, how often,

<p>
<q>And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance,
while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments

kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath
sinned. And <hi rend='italic'>he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering,
and slay the sin-offering in the place of the burnt offering</hi>.</q>
Lev. 4:27-29.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;According to
this, if a man sinned in Israel, he violated one
of the ten commandments that were in the ark under the mercy-seat.
These commandments are the foundation of God's government. To violate
them is to commit sin, and so become subject to death. 1 John 3:4;
Rom. 6:23. But there was a mercy-seat reared above these holy and
just commandments. In the dispensation of His mercy, God grants the
sinner the privilege of confessing his sins, and bringing a substitute to
meet the demands of the law, and thus of obtaining mercy.
</quote>

<p>
12. What was done with the blood of the offering?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his
finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,
and <hi rend='italic'>shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the
altar</hi>.</q> Verse 30.
</p>

<pb n='240'/><anchor id='Pg240'/>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;After a
person discovered his sin by the law which demanded
the death of the transgressor, he first brought his offering, then he confessed
his sin while laying his hands on the head of the victim, thus, in
figure, transferring his sin to the victim; the victim was next slain in the
court, or outer part of the sanctuary, and its blood put on the horns of the
altar and poured at the foot of the altar. In this way sins were pardoned,
and, in the typical service, transferred to the sanctuary.

<p>
13. After the accumulation of the sins of the year in this
way, what service took place on the tenth day of the seventh
month of each year?

<p>
<q>And this shall be a statute forever unto you: that in the

your souls, ... for <hi rend='italic'>on that day shall the priest make an

your sins before the Lord</hi>.</q> Lev. 16:29, 30.
</p>

<p>
14. How was the sanctuary itself to be cleansed, and how
were the sins of the people to be finally disposed of?
</p>

<p>
<q>And he [the high priest] shall take of the congregation of
the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin-offering....
And he shall take the two goats, and present them before
the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats, one lot <hi rend='italic'>for the

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The Hebrew word
for scapegoat is Azazel. See margin of

which the Lord's lot fell; and, bearing the accumulated sins of the year
in before the mercy-seat, he there, in type, atoned for them, and so cleansed

22. At the death of Christ, what miraculous occurrence
signified that the priestly work and services of the earthly
sanctuary were finished?
</p>

<p>
<q>Jesus, when He had cried again with a loud voice, yielded
up the ghost. And, behold, <hi rend='italic'>the veil of the temple was rent in

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;Type had met
antitype; the shadow had reached the substance.
Christ, the great sacrifice, had been slain, and was about to enter
upon His final work as our great high priest in the sanctuary in heaven.
<pb n='243'/><anchor id='Pg243'/>
The priestly work in the earthly sanctuary was typical of the work of
Christ in the heavenly sanctuary. In the earthly, the atonement was
performed on the last day of the ceremonial year. All who did not then
have their sins atoned for were <q>cut off,</q> and the camp was cleansed from
sin. The atonement day was virtually a day of judgment for Israel, and
the people whose sins had been atoned for were free from sin, and could
enter upon the services of the new year clean in the sight of God. This
work was kept up year after year. In the heavenly sanctuary, the sacrifice
is offered but once; and but one atonement, or cleansing of the heavenly
sanctuary, can be made, which must take place at the time assigned of
God for it. And when the great atonement, or cleansing, of the heavenly
sanctuary has been made, God's people will be forever free from sin, and
the fate of all will be forever sealed. See Rev. 22:11. This, as in the
type, will be a day of judgment.
</p>

<p>
The round of service in the earthly sanctuary was God's service. It
had to do with the sins of the people; not that the blood of the sacrifices
offered there could in itself take away their sins, for it is expressly said that
it could not. Heb. 10:4. It could, however, show their <emph>faith</emph> in the
efficacy of <emph>Christ's blood</emph> yet to be spilled, and to which the sanctuary work
was intended constantly to direct their minds. The work there was a
type, or shadow, of Christ's atoning work, and, as such, carries with it a
significance that cannot be overestimated. Upon a correct understanding
of the type depends a correct understanding of the antitype. The entire
sanctuary service was an object-lesson of most important and vital gospel
truth,&mdash;that of man's salvation and the atonement of sin.

the heavenly?

<q>Who serve unto the <hi rend='italic'>example</hi>

<p>
<q>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may
be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from
<pb n='244'/><anchor id='Pg244'/>
the presence of the Lord; and <hi rend='italic'>He shall send Jesus Christ</hi>, which

... to the Ancient of days, and they brought Him near
before Him. And there was given Him <hi rend='italic'>dominion</hi>,

and <hi rend='italic'>a kingdom</hi>, that all people, nations, and languages, should
serve Him.</q> Dan. 7:13, 14.

<p>
28. What will occur when the Lord descends from heaven?
</p>

<p>
<q>For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a
shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of
God: and <hi rend='italic'>the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive
and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to
meet the Lord in the air</hi>: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</q>
1 Thess. 4:16, 17.
</p>

<p>
29. What statement immediately following the announcement
mentioned in Rev. 22:11, indicates that a judgment
work had been in progress before Christ comes?
</p>

<p>
<q>And, behold, I come quickly; and <hi rend='italic'>My reward is with Me, to
give every man according as his work shall be</hi>.</q> Rev. 22:12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The typical
sanctuary service is fully met in the work of
Christ. As the atonement day of the former dispensation was really a
day of judgment, so the atonement work of Christ will include the investigation
of the cases of His people prior to His coming the second time
to receive them unto Himself.

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;During this
judgment scene, both the righteous and the
wicked dead are still in their graves. The record of each one's life, however,
is in the books of heaven, and by that record their characters and deeds
are well known. Christ is there to appear in behalf of those who have
chosen Him as their advocate. 1 John 2:1. He presents His blood, as
He appeals for their sins to be blotted from the books of record. As the
place of judgment is in heaven, where God's throne is, and as Christ is
present in person, it follows that the work of judgment is also in heaven.
All are judged by the record of their lives, and thus answer for the deeds
done in the body. This work will not only decide forever the cases of the
dead, but will also close the probation of all who are living, after which
Christ will come to take to Himself those who have been found loyal to Him.

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;There are three
phases of the judgment mentioned in the
Scriptures,&mdash;the investigative judgment, preceding the second advent;
the judgment of the lost world and wicked angels by Christ and the saints
during the one thousand years following the second advent; and the executive
judgment, or punishment of the wicked at the close of this period.
The investigative judgment takes place in heaven before Christ comes,
in order to ascertain who are worthy to be raised in the first resurrection,
at His coming, and who among the living are to be changed in the twinkling
of an eye, at the sound of the last trump. It is necessary for this to
take place before the second advent, as there will be no time for such a
work between the coming of Christ and the raising of the righteous dead.
The executive judgment on the wicked occurs after their cases have been
examined by the saints during the thousand years. Rev. 20:4, 5; 1 Cor.
6:1-3. The investigative judgment is that which is announced to the
world by the angel's message of Rev. 14:6, 7.

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;There is only
one gospel (Rom. 1:16, 17; Gal. 1:8), first
announced in Eden (Gen. 3:15), preached to Abraham (Gal. 3:8) and to
the children of Israel (Heb. 4:1, 2), and proclaimed anew in every generation.
In its development, the gospel meets the needs of every crisis in
the world's history. John the Baptist in his preaching announced the
kingdom of heaven at hand (Matt. 3:1, 2), and prepared the way for the
first advent. John 1:22, 23. Christ Himself in His preaching of the
gospel announced the fulfilment of a definite-time prophecy (the sixty-nine
weeks, or 483 years, of Dan. 9:25), and called the people to repentance,
in view of the coming of the predicted Messiah. Mark 1:14, 15. So when
the time of the judgment comes, and Christ's second advent is near, a
world-wide announcement of these events is to be made in the preaching
of the everlasting gospel adapted to meet the need of the hour.

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Our Lord
based His preaching of the gospel upon the fulfilment
of the first part of the 2300 days, or years (Mark 1:14, 15), a prophecy
which determined the time of the first advent. The whole period extends
to the time of the judgment, just preceding the second advent, and at its
expiration a special gospel message is sent to all the world proclaiming the
judgment-hour at hand, and calling upon all to worship the Creator. The
facts of history answer to this interpretation of the prophecy: for at this
very time (1844) just such a message was being proclaimed in various
parts of the world. This was the beginning of the great second advent
message which is now being proclaimed throughout the world.

the heavens and the earth</hi>, even they shall perish from the earth....
<hi rend='italic'>He [the true God] hath made the earth by His power, He
hath established the world by His wisdom, and hath stretched out
the heavens by His discretion.</hi></q> Jer. 10:11, 12.
</p>

<p>
12. For what reason is worship justly due to God?
</p>

<p>
<q>For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all
gods.... <hi rend='italic'>The sea is His, and He made it: and His hands formed
<pb n='253'/><anchor id='Pg253'/>
the dry land</hi>. O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel
before the Lord our <hi rend='italic'>Maker</hi>.</q> Ps. 95:3-6.
</p>

<p>
13. Why do the inhabitants of heaven worship God?
</p>

<p>
<q>The four and twenty elders fall down before Him, ...
saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor
and power: <hi rend='italic'>for Thou hast created all things</hi>, and for Thy pleasure
they are and were created.</q> Rev. 4:10, 11.
</p>

<p>
14. What memorial did God establish of His creative power?
</p>

<p>
<q>Remember <hi rend='italic'>the Sabbath day</hi>, to keep
it holy.... <hi rend='italic'>For in
six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in
them is</hi>, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed
the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</q> Ex. 20:8-11.
</p>

<p>
15. What place has the Sabbath in the work of salvation?
</p>

<p>
<q>Moreover also I gave them My Sabbaths, to be <hi rend='italic'>a sign</hi> between
Me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord
that <hi rend='italic'>sanctify</hi> them.</q> Eze. 20:12.
</p>

<p>
16. How many are concerned in the judgment?
</p>

<p>
<q>For we must <hi rend='italic'>all</hi> appear before the judgment-seat of Christ;
that <hi rend='italic'>every one</hi> may receive the things
done in his body, <hi rend='italic'>according
to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad</hi>.</q> 2 Cor. 5:10.
</p>

<p>
17. What will be the standard in the judgment?
</p>

<p>
<q>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in
one point, he is guilty of all. For He that said, Do not commit
adultery; said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery,
yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged <hi rend='italic'>by the law
of liberty</hi>.</q> James 2:10-12.
</p>

<p>
18. In view of the judgment, what exhortation is given?
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: <hi rend='italic'>Fear God,
and keep His commandments</hi>: for this is the whole duty of man.
For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every
secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</q> Eccl.
12:13, 14.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;A comparison
of Rev. 14:7 with Eccl. 12:13, 14, suggests
that the way to give glory to God is to keep His commandments, and that
in giving the judgment-hour message, the duty of keeping the commandments
would be emphasized. This is plainly shown in the description
given of the people who are gathered out of every nation, kindred, tongue,
and people as the result of the preaching of this message, in connection
with the other messages which immediately follow and accompany it.
Of this people it is said, <q>Here are they that keep the commandments of
God, and the faith of Jesus.</q> Rev. 14:12.

</p>

<p>
<q>And there followed another angel, saying, <hi rend='italic'>Babylon is fallen,

</p>

<p>
2. What reason is assigned for the fall of Babylon?
</p>

<p>
<q>Because <hi rend='italic'>she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath
of her fornication</hi>.</q> Same verse, last part.
</p>

<p>
3. How was the overthrow of ancient Babylon foretold?
</p>

<p>

5. What did ancient Babylon do to all the nations?
</p>

<p>
<q>Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord's hand, that
<hi rend='italic'>made all the earth drunken</hi>: the nations have drunken of her
<hi rend='italic'>wine</hi>; therefore the nations are
<hi rend='italic'>mad</hi>.</q> Verse 7.

<p>
6. What was the effect of this apostasy?
</p>

<p>
<q>Babylon is <hi rend='italic'>suddenly fallen and destroyed</hi>: howl for her;

take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.</q> Verse 8.
</p>

<p>
7. Just before the fall of Babylon, what did her king do?
</p>

<p>
<q>Belshazzar the king <hi rend='italic'>made a great feast</hi> to a thousand of his
lords, and <hi rend='italic'>drank wine</hi> before the thousand.</q> Dan. 5:1.
</p>

<p>
8. By what command did the king repudiate the religion
taught in Babylon by Daniel and others who feared God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring
the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar
had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the
king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might
drink therein.</q> Verse 2.
</p>

<p>
9. What marked the climax of Babylon's apostasy?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out
of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and
the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank
in them.</q> Verse 3.
</p>

<p>
10. While drinking the wine, what gods did they honor?
</p>

<p>
<q>They drank wine, and <hi rend='italic'>praised the gods of gold, and of silver,
of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone</hi>.</q> Verse 4.
</p>

<p>
11. What immediately followed this complete apostasy?
</p>

<p>
<q>In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans
slain. And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about
threescore and two years old.</q> Verses 30, 31.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The gospel
of the kingdom was preached in Babylon (see
reading on <q>The Gospel of the Kingdom,</q> page 209), and Nebuchadnezzar
was brought to acknowledge and to worship the true God. But after the
death of Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon relapsed into idolatry again, and this
apostasy was rendered hopeless when Belshazzar used the sacred vessels
from the house of God, dedicated to the worship of God, in which to
drink the wine of Babylon while worship was offered to the false gods.
Then came the handwriting on the wall, and the fall of ancient Babylon.

13. In this same prophecy, how is the Church of Rome, the
Papacy, designated as the antitype of ancient Babylon?
</p>

<pb n='256'/><anchor id='Pg256'/>

<q>And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY,
BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS

</p>

<p>
14. What specific statement emphasizes this identification?
</p>

<p>
<q>With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication,
and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk
with the wine of her fornication.</q> Verse 2. See verse 4.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;The
Church of Rome is called Babylon, and its religion
is a revival of the religion of ancient Babylon. She claims a priesthood
with exceptional powers and privileges, just as did ancient Babylon.
Through the dogma of the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary, she
denies that God in Christ dwelt in the same flesh as fallen man has, just
as ancient Babylon did. See Dan. 2:11. She claims universal spiritual
jurisdiction, and demands submission under pains and penalties, just as
ancient Babylon did. See Daniel 3. She repudiates the fundamental
gospel truth of justification by faith, and boasts of works, just as ancient
Babylon did. See Dan. 4:30. A careful comparison of the ritual of
ancient and modern Babylon shows that the latter is copied from the
former; and it is easy to trace the connection historically through the
paganism of political Rome.
</p>

<p>
On the overthrow of Babylon by the Persians, who nourished a traditional
hatred for its idolatry, the Chaldean priesthood fled to Pergamos,
in Asia Minor, and made it the headquarters of their religion....
The last pontiff king of Pergamos was Attalus III, who at his death bequeathed
his dominions and authority to the Roman people, 133 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi>, and
from that time the two lines of Pontifex Maximus were merged in the
Roman one.&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>The False

</p>

<p>
<q>This cup is the new covenant in My blood.</q> Luke 22:20,

</p>

<p>
16. What is the essential teaching of the new covenant?
</p>

<p>
<q>For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
Israel after those days, saith the Lord; <hi rend='italic'>I will put My laws into

does it become?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus</hi> hath made
me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could
not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His
own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned
sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled
in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</q>
Rom. 8:2-4.
</p>

<p>
18. In what other statement is this same truth expressed?
</p>

<pb n='257'/><anchor id='Pg257'/>

<p>
<q>It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing:
the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are

</p>

<p>
19. What kind of teaching have men substituted for the
words which are spirit and life?
</p>

<p>
<q>Howbeit in vain do they worship Me, <hi rend='italic'>teaching for doctrines
the commandments of men</hi>.... And He said unto them,

your own <hi rend='italic'>tradition</hi>.</q> Mark 7:7-9.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;There are
two cups, the cup of the Lord and the cup of
Babylon. The wine in the Lord's cup represents the living truth, <q>as
the truth is in Jesus;</q> the wine in the cup of Babylon represents her false
doctrines, her substitution of human tradition for the living word and law
of God, and the illicit connection which she has made between the church
and the secular power, depending upon political power to enforce her teachings,
rather than upon the power of God. By this very thing, while maintaining
a form of godliness, she denies the power thereof. 2 Tim. 3:1-5.
</p>

<p>
The following quotation states the position of that church in regard to
tradition: <q>Though these two divine streams [the Bible and tradition] are
in themselves, on account of their divine origin, of equal sacredness, and
are both full of revealed truths, still, of the two, tradition is to us more clear
and safe.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>Catholic Belief,</q>
Rev. Joseph Faa Di Bruno, D. D. (Roman
Catholic), page 45.</hi>
</p>

<p>
The substitution of the law of the church for the law of God, in fulfilment
of the prophecy in Dan. 7:25, testifies to the complete subordination
of the Word of God to the authority of the church. The world-wide teaching
of these doctrines in place of the pure gospel has led the world astray,
and has made all the nations drink of the wine of her fornication. The
Reformation of the sixteenth century was an effort to return to the pure
truths of God's Word. In this the Reformers denied the supremacy of
tradition over the Bible.

<p>
20. What relation does the Church of Rome sustain to other
apostate churches?
</p>

<p>
<q>And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY,
BABYLON THE GREAT, <hi rend='italic'>THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS</hi>
AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</q> Rev. 17:5.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;In the
creed of Pope Pius IV, an authoritative statement of
Roman Catholic belief, is found this statement: <q>I acknowledge the Holy
Catholic Apostolic Church for <emph>the mother and
mistress of all churches</emph>.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Article
10.</hi> When the professed Protestant churches repudiate the
fundamental principle of Protestantism by setting aside the authority of
God's Word, and accepting tradition and human speculation in its place,
they adopt the fundamental principle of modern Babylon, and may be regarded
as the daughters of Babylon. Their fall is then included in the
fall of Babylon, and calls for a proclamation of the fall of modern Babylon.
</p>

<p>
Many representatives of modern Protestantism have, in one way or
another, rejected many fundamental doctrines of the Bible, such as,&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l>The fall of man.</l>
<l>The Bible doctrine of sin.</l>
<l>The infallibility of the Scriptures.</l>
<l>The sufficiency of the Scriptures as a rule of faith and practise.</l>
<pb n='258'/><anchor id='Pg258'/>
<l>The Deity of Christ, and His consequent headship over the church.</l>
<l>The miraculous conception and the virgin birth of our Lord.</l>
<l>The resurrection of Christ from the grave.</l>
<l>The vicarious, expiatory, and propitiatory atonement of Christ.</l>
<l>Salvation by grace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.</l>
<l>Regeneration by the power of the Holy Ghost.</l>
<l>The efficacy of the all-prevailing name of Christ in prayer.</l>
<l>The ministration and guardianship of holy angels.</l>
<l>Miracles as the direct manifestation and interposition of God's power.</l>
</lg>

<p>
Although many leaders of modern Protestantism known as higher
critics have not formally adopted the creed of the Church of Rome, and
have not become an organic part of that body, yet they belong to the same
class in rejecting the authority of God's Word, and accepting in its place
the product of their own reasonings. There is just as much apostasy in
the one case as in the other, and both must therefore be included in Babylon,
and both will go down in the fall of Babylon. The warning message
applies with equal force to both classes.
</p>
</quote>

<p>
21. To what extent is the apostasy, or fall, of modern Babylon,
the mother, and of her daughters, to be carried?
</p>

<p>
<q>And after these things I saw another angel come down
from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened
with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice,
saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and <hi rend='italic'>is become the
habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of
every unclean and hateful bird</hi>. For all nations have drunk of
the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the
earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants
of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.</q>
Rev. 18:1-3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In its
largest sense, Babylon includes all false religions&mdash;all
apostasy. The gospel message announcing her final overthrow should
be a cause of rejoicing to every lover of truth and righteousness.

<p>
22. What final call to come out of Babylon is to go forth?
</p>

<p>
<q>And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, <hi rend='italic'>Come out
of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
receive not of her plagues</hi>. For her sins have reached unto
heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.</q> Verses 4, 5.
</p>

<p>
23. How complete is to be the fall of modern Babylon?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and
cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city
Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all</hi>.... And
in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and
of all that were slain upon the earth.</q> Verses 21-24.

</p>

<p>
<q>And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise

And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard,
and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as
the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his
seat, and great authority.</q> Rev. 13:1, 2.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In this
composite beast from the sea are combined the symbols
of the seventh chapter of Daniel, representing Greece, Medo-Persia,
and Babylon. The blasphemous words spoken by it, its persecution of
the saints, and the time allotted to it (verses 5-7) show that this beast, under
one of its seven-headed manifestations, is identical with the little horn of
the vision of the seventh chapter of Daniel, modern Babylon, the Papacy.
See reading on <q>The Kingdom and Work of Antichrist,</q> page 218. The
false worship here mentioned, the worship of the beast, is the rendering of
that homage to the Papacy which is due to God alone. The system of
religion enforced by the Papacy is the paganism of Babylon, Medo-Persia,
Greece, and Rome, indicated by the composite character of the beast
(verse 2), disguised under the forms and names of Christianity. The
Pontifex Maximus of the ancient pagan religions was continued in the
Pope, who is the head of the Roman priesthood, and who, in the exercise
of his priestly functions, took away the mediation of Christ, and substituted
a system of human mediation in its place, thus fulfilling the prophecy recorded
in the eighth chapter of Daniel. See reading on <q>The Vicar of
Christ,</q> page 224.

the blood of Christ, and the cup of the wine of the wrath of Babylon are
both offered to the world. To drink of the former, that is, to accept the
teaching of the true gospel, is to receive everlasting life; but to drink of the
wine of Babylon, that is, to accept the false gospel taught by the Papacy,
will result in drinking of the wine of the wrath of God from the cup of His
indignation. The true gospel means everlasting life; the false gospel means
everlasting death.

<p>
<q>And the devil, taking Him up into an high mountain,

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
threefold message of Rev. 14:6-12 is proclaimed in
connection with the closing scenes of the great controversy between Christ
and Satan. Lucifer has sought to put himself in the place of God (Isa.
14:12-14), and to secure to himself the worship which is due God alone.
The final test comes over the commandments of God. Those who acknowledge
the supremacy of the beast by yielding obedience to the law of God as
changed and enforced by the Papacy, when the real issue has been clearly
defined, will, in so doing, worship the beast and his image, and receive his
mark. Such will take the side of Satan in his rebellion against the authority
of God.

    <head>The Death Of Christ.
"He [Satan]
persecuted the woman [the church] that
brought forth the man child." Rev. 12:13.</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
1. Under what figure was the Christian church represented
to the apostle John?
</p>

<p>
<q>And there appeared a great wonder [margin, sign] in
heaven; <hi rend='italic'>a woman</hi> clothed with the sun, and the moon under her
feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.</q> Rev. 12:1.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;Frequently in
the Scriptures a woman is used to represent
the church. See Jer. 6:2; 2 Cor. 11:2. The sun represents the light of
the gospel with which the church was clothed at the first advent (1 John
2:8); the moon under her feet, the waning light of the former dispensation;
and the twelve stars, the twelve apostles.
</p>

<p>
<q>Woman in her innocence was attacked by <q>that old serpent, called
the Devil, and Satan.</q> ... At the end of that first crafty assault and
speedy victory the dragon met with his rebuff, in words like these: <q>The
seed of the woman shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise His heel.</q>
... In the Revelation the scene is changed from Eden to the heavens,
and before you stand again the woman and the serpent, in the same position
of antagonism as before, the serpent still the assailant, only this time more
openly so.... The woman is no longer a simple, childlike personage,
but <emph>a wonder</emph>; she walks not among the trees and flowers, but amid the
orbs of heaven. She is clothed with the sun, the moon is under her feet,
and upon her head is a coronet of twelve stars. In her you see the great
cause of truth and righteousness embodied&mdash;she is, in fact, the church of
God in all ages, the woman whose Seed blesses all the nations of
the earth.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>C.
H. Spurgeon, in The Tabernacle Pulpit, March 15, 1896.</hi>

<pb n='265'/><anchor id='Pg265'/>

<p>
2. How is the church at the first advent described?
</p>

<p>
<q>And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and
pained to be delivered.</q> Verse 2.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The church is
in labor and pain while she brings forth Christ
and her children, in the midst of afflictions and persecutions. See Rom.
8:19, 22; 1 John 3:1, 2; 2 Tim. 3:12.
</quote>

<p>
3. How are the birth, work, and ascension of Christ briefly
described?
</p>

<p>
<q>And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all
nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto
God, and to His throne.</q> Verse 5.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Specifically this
must refer to Christ (see Ps. 2:7-9); but
through Him is also prefigured the experience of the people of God, who
finally in the judgment are to share with Christ in ruling the nations with
a rod of iron (Rev. 2:26, 27), and, like Him, when their work on earth
is accomplished be <q>caught up,</q> at His appearing, to God and to His
throne. 1 Thess. 4:15-17.
</quote>

<p>
4. What other sign, or wonder, appeared in heaven?
</p>

<p>
<q>And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold
<hi rend='italic'>a great red dragon</hi>, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven
crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the
stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon
stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to
devour her child as soon as in was born.</q> Verses 3, 4.
</p>

<p>
5. Who is this dragon said to be?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the great dragon was cast out, <hi rend='italic'>that old serpent</hi>, called
the <hi rend='italic'>Devil</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>Satan</hi>,
which deceiveth the whole world.</q> Verse 9.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Primarily
the dragon represents Satan, the great enemy and
persecutor of the church in all ages. But Satan works through principalities
and powers in his efforts to destroy the people of God. It was
through a Roman king, King Herod, that he sought to destroy Christ as
soon as He was born. Matt. 2:16. Rome must therefore be symbolized
by the dragon. The seven heads of the dragon are interpreted by some
to refer to the <q>seven hills</q> upon which the city of Rome is built; by others,
to the seven forms of government through which Rome passed; and by still
others, and more broadly, to the seven great monarchies which have oppressed
the people of God; namely, Egypt, Assyria, Chaldea, Persia, Greece,
pagan Rome, and papal Rome, in either of which Rome is represented
and included. See page <ref target='Pg269'>269</ref>. The ten horns, as in the fourth
beast of Daniel 7, evidently refer to the ten kingdoms into which Rome was finally
divided, and thus again identify the dragon with the Roman power.
</quote>

<p>
6. How is the conflict between Christ and Satan described?
</p>

<p>
<q>And there was war in heaven; Michael and His angels
fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,
and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in
<pb n='266'/><anchor id='Pg266'/>
heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent,
called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world:
he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with
him.</q> Verses 7-9.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This conflict, begun
in heaven, continues on earth. Near
the close of Christ's ministry, He said, <q>I beheld Satan as lightning <emph>fall
from heaven</emph>.</q> Luke 10:18. <q>Now is the judgment of this world: now
shall the prince of this world be <emph>cast out</emph>.</q> John 12:31. From the councils
of the representatives of the various worlds to which Satan, as the prince
of this world, was formerly admitted (Job 1:6, 7; 2:1, 2), he was cast out
when he crucified Christ, the Son of God.
</quote>

<p>
7. What shout of triumph was heard in heaven following the
victory gained by Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, <hi rend='italic'>Now is come
salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power
of His Christ</hi>: for the accuser of our brethren is <hi rend='italic'>cast down</hi>,
which accused them before our God day and night.... Therefore
rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.</q> Verses
10-12.
</p>

<p>
8. Why was woe at this same time proclaimed to the world?
</p>

<p>
<q>Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! <hi rend='italic'>for the
devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth
that he hath but a short time</hi>.</q> Verse 12, last part.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This
not only shows that, since the crucifixion of Christ,
Satan knows that his doom is sealed, and that he has but a limited time
in which to work, but that his efforts are largely if not wholly now confined
to this world, and concentrated upon its inhabitants. Better than
many professed Christians, Satan knows that time is short.
</quote>

<p>
9. What did the dragon do when cast to the earth?
</p>

<p>
<q>And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth,
<hi rend='italic'>he persecuted the woman</hi> which brought forth the man child.</q>
Verse 13.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The persecution
of Christians began under pagan Rome, but
was carried on far more extensively under papal Rome. Matt. 24:21, 22.
</quote>

<p>
10. What definite period of time was allotted to this great
persecution of God's people under papal Rome?
</p>

<p>
<q>And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle,
that she might fly into the wilderness, unto her place, where she
is nourished for <hi rend='italic'>a time, and times, and half a time</hi>, from the face
of the serpent.</q> Verse 14.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This is the
same period as that mentioned in Dan. 7:25,
and, like the ten horns, identifies the dragon with the fourth beast of Daniel
7, and its later work with the work of the little horn of that same beast.
In Rev. 13:5 this period is referred to as <q>forty-two months,</q> and in Rev.
12:6 as 1260 days, each representing 1260 literal years, the period allotted
<pb n='267'/><anchor id='Pg267'/>
to the supremacy of papal Rome. Beginning in
538 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>, it ended in 1798,
when the Pope was taken prisoner by the French. See notes on page
<ref target='Pg223'>223</ref>.
The woman fleeing into the wilderness fittingly describes the condition
of the church during those times of bitter persecution.
</quote>

<p>
11. What was Satan's design in thus persecuting the church?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood
after the woman, <hi rend='italic'>that he might cause her to be carried away of the
flood</hi>.</q> Verse 15.
</p>

<p>
12. How was the flood stayed, and Satan's design defeated?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>And the earth helped the woman</hi>, and the earth opened her
mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out
of his mouth.</q> Verse 16.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The mountain
fastnesses, quiet retreats, and secluded valleys
of southwestern Europe for centuries shielded many who refused allegiance
to the Papacy. Here, too, may be seen the results of the work of the
Reformation of the sixteenth century, when many of the governments
of Europe came to the help of the cause of reform, by staying the hand of
persecution and protecting the lives of those who dared to take their stand
for the right. The discovery of America, and the opening up of this
country as an asylum for the oppressed of Europe at this time, may also
be included in the <q>help</q> here referred to.
</quote>

<p>
13. What did Christ say would be the result if the days of
persecution were not shortened?
</p>

<p>
<q>Except those days should be shortened, <hi rend='italic'>there should no
flesh be saved</hi>: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.</q>
Matt. 24: 22.
</p>

<p>
14. Still bent on persecution, how does Satan manifest his
enmity against the remnant church?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and <hi rend='italic'>went to
make war with the remnant of her seed</hi>, which keep the commandments
of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</q> Rev. 12:17.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;To the
very end, Satan will persecute and seek to destroy the
people of God. Against the remnant, or last portion of the church, he is
especially to make war. Their obedience to God's commandments, and
their possession of the testimony of Jesus, or spirit of prophecy (Rev. 19:10),
are especially offensive to him, and excite his intense ire.

<p>
1. What is the first symbol of Revelation 13?
</p>

<p>
<q>And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw <hi rend='italic'>a beast rise
up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns</hi>, and upon his
horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.</q>
Rev. 13:1.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;As already
learned from studying the book of Daniel, a
beast in prophecy represents some great earthly power or kingdom; a
head, a governing power; horns, a number of kingdoms; crowned heads or
crowned horns, political rulership; waters, <q>peoples, and multitudes, and
nations, and tongues.</q> Rev. 17:15.
</p>

<p>
<q>The beasts of Daniel and John are empires. The ten-horned beast
is the Roman power.... The head is the governing power of the
body. The heads of this beast represent successive
governments.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>Romanism
and the Reformation,</q> by H. Grattan Guinness, pages 144, 145.</hi>
</p>
</quote>

<p>
2. How is this beast further described?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the beast which I saw was <hi rend='italic'>like unto a leopard</hi>, and his
feet were as <hi rend='italic'>the feet of a bear</hi>,
and his mouth as <hi rend='italic'>the mouth of a
lion</hi>.</q> Verse 2, first part.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;These are the
characteristics of the first three symbols of
Daniel 7,&mdash;the <emph>lion</emph>, <emph>bear</emph>, and <emph>leopard</emph>
there representing the kingdoms of
<emph>Babylon</emph>, <emph>Medo-Persia</emph>, and <emph>Grecia</emph>,&mdash;and
suggest this beast as representing
or belonging to the kingdom symbolized by the <emph>fourth beast</emph> of Daniel 7,
or <emph>Rome</emph>. Both have ten horns. Like the dragon of Revelation 12, it
<pb n='269'/><anchor id='Pg269'/>
also has seven heads; but as the dragon symbolized Rome in its entirety,
particularly in its pagan phase, this, like the <q>little horn</q> coming up among
the ten horns of the fourth beast of Daniel 7, represents Rome in its later
or papal form. Both it and the little horn have <q>a mouth</q> speaking great
things; both make war upon the saints; both continue for the same length
of time.
</p>

<p>
Allowing a very broad meaning to the symbol, the Douay or Catholic
Bible, in a note on Rev. 13:1, explains the seven heads of this beast as
follows: <q>The seven heads are seven kings, that is, seven principal kingdoms
or empires, which have exercised, or shall exercise, tyrannical power
over the people of God: of these, five were then fallen, viz., the Egyptian,
Assyrian, Chaldean, Persian, and Grecian monarchies; one was present,
viz., the empire of Rome; and the seventh and chiefest was to come, viz.,
the great Antichrist and his empire.</q> That the seventh head represents
Antichrist there can be little doubt. See page <ref target='Pg265'>265</ref>.
</p>
</quote>

<p>
3. What did the dragon give this beast?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the dragon gave him his <hi rend='italic'>power</hi>,
and his <hi rend='italic'>seat</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>great
authority</hi>.</q> Verse 2, latter part.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;It is
an undisputed fact of history that under the later Roman
emperors, beginning with Constantine, the religion of the Roman government
was changed from pagan to papal; that when Constantine removed
the seat of his empire from Rome to Constantinople
in 330 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>, the city
of Rome was given up to the bishop of Rome, who, from Constantine and
succeeding emperors, received rich gifts and great authority; that after
the fall of Rome, in 476 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>,
the bishop of Rome became the ruling power
in Western Rome, and by decree of Justinian, March 15, 533, was declared
<q>head of all the holy churches,</q> and in a letter of the same year he was
designated as <q>corrector of heretics.</q> See note on page
<ref target='Pg223'>223</ref>. Thus Rome
pagan became Rome papal; the seat of pagan Rome became the seat of
papal Rome; church and state were united; and the persecuting power of
the dragon was conferred upon the professed head of the church of Christ,
or papal Rome. As Dr. H. Grattan Guinness, in his <q>Romanism and the
Reformation,</q> page 152, says, <q>The power of the Cæsars lived again in the
universal dominion of the popes.</q>
</quote>

<p>
4. How are the character, work, period of supremacy, and
great power of the beast described?
</p>

<p>
<q>And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great
things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue
forty and two months. And he opened his mouth in
blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, and His tabernacle,
and them that dwell in heaven. And it was given unto
him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and
power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.</q>
Verses 5-7.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;All
these specifications have been fully and accurately met
in the Papacy, and identify this beast as representing the same power as
that represented by the little horn phase of the fourth beast of Daniel
7, and the little horn of Daniel 8, in its chief and essential features and
work. See Dan. 7:25; 8:11, 12, 24, 25, and readings on pages
<ref target='Pg218'>218</ref>, <ref target='Pg224'>224</ref>.

5. What was to be inflicted upon one of the heads of this
beast?
</p>

<p>
<q>And I saw <hi rend='italic'>one of his heads as it were wounded to death</hi>; and
his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after
the beast.</q> Verse 3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This wound
was inflicted upon the papal head of this beast
when the French, in 1798, entered Rome, and took the Pope prisoner, and
for a time, it seemed, abolished the Papacy. But in 1800 another Pope
was placed upon the papal throne, and the deadly wound began to be
healed. Temporal dominion was taken away from the Papacy in 1870,
but nevertheless its power and influence among the nations have been increasing
since then. <q>In that year,</q> says Mr. Guinness in his work <q>Romanism
and the Reformation,</q> page 156, <q>the Papacy assumed the highest
exaltation to which it could aspire, that of infallibility.</q> To such a

<p>
1. When was the papal head of the first beast of Revelation
13 wounded?
</p>

<p>
In 1793-98, by the French Revolution, and the temporary
overthrow of the Papacy in the latter year.
</p>

<p>
2. What did the prophet see coming up at this time?
</p>

<p>
<q>And I beheld <hi rend='italic'>another beast coming up out of the earth</hi>; and
he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</q> Rev. 13:11.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;Mr. Wesley, in
his notes on Revelation 13, written in 1754,
says of the two-horned beast: <q>He is not yet come, though he cannot be
far off; for he is to appear at the end of the forty-two months of the first
beast.</q>
</p>

<p>
The previous beast came up out of the <q>sea,</q> which indicates its rise
among the peoples and nations of the world then in existence (Rev 17:
15); while this one comes up out of the <q>earth.</q> This would indicate that
the latter beast would arise where there had not before been <q>peoples, and
multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</q> In 1798, when the papal power
received its deadly wound, the government of the United States, located
in the western continent, was the only great and independent nation then
coming into prominence in territory not previously occupied by peoples,
multitudes, and nations. Only nine years preceding this (1789), the United
States adopted its national Constitution.
</p>

<p>
It is within the territory of the United States, therefore, that we
may look, according to the prophecy, for an ecclesiastical movement to
arise, and exercise a dominating control, not only in the civil government
of this country, but also in the other nations of the whole world as well.

3. What is the character of this new power?
</p>

<p>
<q>He had <hi rend='italic'>two horns like a lamb</hi>.</q> Rev. 13:11.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The Pilgrim
Fathers were the vanguard of a great multitude
of Protestants, who, when persecuted and outlawed in the lands of
their birth, sought refuge in the New World, where they developed rapidly
under the protection of a government founded on the great Christian
principles of civil and religious freedom. The two horns may well symbolize
these two fundamental principles.
</quote>

<p>
4. Notwithstanding the lamblike appearance of this power,
what is it ultimately to do?
</p>

<p>
<q>And he <hi rend='italic'>spake as a dragon</hi>.</q> Rev. 13:11.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The voice
of the dragon is the voice of intolerance and persecution.
This indicates that the ecclesiastical development dealt with
in this prophecy, obtaining a foothold for its initial power and influence
in the government of the United States, will repudiate the mild and
lamblike principles of civil and religious liberty, and become like the
beast before it, a world-wide persecuting power. This is why in Rev.
19:20 it is called <q>the false prophet.</q> Born of the Reformation, it will
repudiate Reformation principles.
</quote>

<p>
5. How much power will this beast exercise?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him</hi>,
and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship
the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</q> Verse 12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The <q>first
beast before him</q> (papal Rome) exercised the
power of persecuting and putting to death all who differed from it in
religious matters. The only way the <emph>earth</emph> can be made to worship is by
causing work to cease on it through voluntary or enforced rest, or sabbath-keeping.
<q>For as long as she [the land] lay desolate she <emph>kept sabbath</emph>.</q>
2 Chron. 36:21. Enforced Sunday observance is evidently implied here.
</quote>

<p>
6. What means will be employed to lead the people back into
this false worship?
</p>

<p>
<q>And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth <hi rend='italic'>by the means of
those miracles which he had power to do</hi> in the sight of the beast.</q>
Verse 14, first part.
</p>

<p>
7. What will this power propose that the people shall do?
</p>

<p>
<q>Saying to them that dwell on the earth, <hi rend='italic'>that they should
make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword; and
did live</hi>.</q> Verse 14, latter part.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The beast
<q>which had the wound by a sword, and did live,</q>
is the Papacy. That was a church dominating the civil power. In other
words, it was a union of church and state, and enforced its religious dogmas
by the civil power, under pain of confiscation of goods, imprisonment, and
death. An image to this beast would be another ecclesiastical organization
clothed with civil power&mdash;another union of church and state&mdash;to
enforce religious dogmas by law.
</quote>

<pb n='274'/><anchor id='Pg274'/>

<p>
8. Is there any evidence that such an image will be made?
</p>

<p>
Large and influential organizations, such as the National
Reform Association, the International Reform Bureau, the
Lord's Day Alliance of the United States, and the Federal
Council of the Churches of Christ in America, have been formed,
by professed Protestants, and for years have been persistently
working to that end. Many Roman Catholic societies recently
formed in the United States, such as the Knights of Columbus
and the American Federation of Catholic Societies, are looking
to a like end&mdash;that of making America Catholic.
</p>

<p>
9. What, according to its constitution, is the avowed object
of the National Reform Association?
</p>

<p>
<q>To secure such an amendment to the Constitution of the
United States as shall ... indicate that this is a Christian
nation, and place all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages
of the government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental
law of the land.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Article II of Constitution.</hi>
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;Upon
the question of making this a <q>Christian nation,</q>
Bishop Earl Cranston, D. D., of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in an
address delivered in Foundry Methodist Episcopal Church, Washington,
D. C., March 13, 1910, made the following observation:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>Suppose this were to be declared a Christian nation by a Constitutional
interpretation to that effect. What would that mean? Which
of the two contending definitions of Christianity would the word Christian
indicate?&mdash;The Protestant idea, of course, for under our system majorities
rule, and the majority of Americans are Protestants. Very well. But
suppose that by the addition of certain contiguous territory with twelve
or more millions of Roman Catholics, the annexation of a few more islands
with half as many more, and the same rate of immigration as now, the
majority some years hence should be Roman Catholics,&mdash;who doubts for
a moment that the reigning Pope would assume control of legislation and
government? He would say, with all confidence and consistency, <q>This
is a Christian nation. It was so claimed from the beginning and so declared
many years ago. A majority defined then what Christianity was,
the majority will define now what Christianity now is and is to be.</q> That
<q>majority</q> would be the Pope.</q>&mdash;<q><hi rend='italic'>The
Church and the Government</hi>,</q> page 7.
</p>

<p>
The National Reformers in their attempts to justify the legal establishment
of Christianity as the national religion, have erroneously declared
that the statement of Justice Brewer of the Supreme Court of the United
States in 1892, <q>This is a Christian nation,</q> is a decision of the court,
whereas it was only a statement in the argument leading up to the decision
of the court.
</p>

<p>
In a sermon at the centenary of the establishment of the Roman
Catholic hierarchy in the United States, in 1889, Archbishop Ireland said:
<q>Our work is to make America Catholic.... Our cry shall be, <q>God
wills it,</q> and our hearts shall leap with crusader enthusiasm.</q>
</p>

<p>
The theory of the National Reformers is thus expressed: <q>Every
government by equitable laws, is a government of God; a republic thus governed
is of Him, and is as truly and really a <emph>theocracy</emph> as the commonwealth
of Israel.</q>&mdash;<q><hi rend='italic'>Cincinnati National
Reform Convention</hi>,</q> page 28.

</quote>

<pb n='275'/><anchor id='Pg275'/>

<p>
10. How does this association regard the Catholic Church
on this point?
</p>

<p>
<q>We cordially, gladly, recognize the fact that in South
American republics, in France and other European countries
the Roman Catholics are the recognized advocates of national
Christianity, and stand opposed to all the proposals of secularism....
<emph>Whenever they are willing to cooperate in resisting
the progress of political atheism, we will gladly join hands
with them</emph> in a world's conference for the promotion of national
Christianity, which ought to be held at no distant day. Many
countries could be represented only by Roman
Catholics.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Christian
Statesman, Dec. 11, 1884, official organ of the
National Reform Association.</hi>
</p>

<p>
11. What has the Pope commanded all Catholics to do?
</p>

<p>
<q>First and foremost, it is the duty of all Catholics worthy
of the name and wishful to be known as most loving children of
the church ... to endeavor to bring back all civil society to
the pattern and form of Christianity which we have
described.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Encyclical
of Pope Leo XIII, <q>Immortale Dei</q> Nov. 1, 1885,
<q>The Great Encyclical Letters of Leo XIII,</q> page 132.</hi>
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The prophecy says
that this power will make an image to the
Papacy. In the days of Constantine and his successors, the church made
use of the civil power to carry out her aims: through this means the Papacy
was developed. In our own day the same theory is advocated, and prominent
men in the nation, in both church and state, are doing all they can
to bring about the same result, which, when their work is completed, cannot
fail to fulfil the specifications of the prophecy. The climax will be
an image of the Papacy.

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;In the fourth
century, Sunday games and Sunday theaters,
it was complained, <q>hindered</q> the <q>devotion</q> of the <q>faithful,</q> because
many of the members attended them in preference to the church services.
The church, therefore, demanded that the state should interfere, and enforce
Sunday observance by law. <q>In this way,</q> says Neander, <q>the
church received help from the state for the furtherance of her ends.</q> In
this way church and state were united, and the Papacy was placed in
power. The same course pursued now will produce the same results.
</p>

<p>
It is proper and right for the church to teach Sabbath observance, and
to decry Sabbath desecration; but it should not attempt to secure Sabbath
observance through compulsory legislation; nor should it seek to fasten
upon the people by any means the observance of a day which God has never
enjoined, and for which, as is admitted on all hands, there is no Scriptural
command. See admissions on pages

See Rev. 14:9, 10, and reading on page
<ref target='Pg446'>446</ref>. God's seal, or mark, is set
in the forehead (Rev. 7:3; 14:1), the seat of the mind, the Lord accepting
only the worship of conviction and conscience. The mark of the beast,
however, is said to be received in the hand or forehead. Some are deceived
and give assent to the false teaching with their minds, receiving the mark
in the forehead; others, coerced or indifferent, give formal, outward consent,
and so receive the mark in the hand.

itself in the movement to enforce Sunday observance. In a sermon
<pb n='278'/><anchor id='Pg278'/>

said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>In the Christian decalogue the first day was made the Sabbath by
divine appointment. But there is a class of people who will not keep the
Christian sabbath unless they are forced to do so. But that can be easily
done. We have twenty million of men, besides women and children, in
this country, who want this country to keep the Christian sabbath. If
we would say we will not sell anything to them, we will not buy anything
from them, we will not work for them, or hire them to work for us, the
thing could be wiped out, and all the world would keep the Christian
sabbath.</q>

the Bible Sabbath, in deference to compulsory Sunday laws?
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The conscientious observance of Sunday as the Sabbath on the part
of those who hitherto have supposed it to be the Sabbath, has, without
doubt, been accepted of God as Sabbath-keeping. It is only when light
comes that sin is imputed. John 9:41; 15:22; Acts 17:30. See page 700.

men, and fasten them in deception?
</p>

<p>
<q>And he doeth great wonders, so that <hi rend='italic'>he maketh fire come

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In the time
of Elijah, in the controversy over Baal-worship,
this was the test as to who was the true God,&mdash;the God that answered by

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;These seven churches,
and the messages addressed to them,
apply to seven periods or states of the church reaching from the first to the
second advent of Christ. <q>Under this emblematical representation of the
seven churches of Asia,</q> says Vitringa, in the <q>Comprehensive Commentary,</q>
<q>the Holy Spirit has delineated seven different states of the Christian
church, which would appear in succession, extending to the coming
of our Lord and the consummation of all things.</q> Their good qualities
and their defects are pointed out, with admonitions, exhortations, and
warnings suitable for each, all of which are also applicable to individual
Christian experience.

<q>Unto the angel of the church of <hi rend='italic'>Ephesus</hi> write.</q> Rev. 2:1.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The meaning
of Ephesus is <emph>desirable</emph>, and fitly describes the
character and condition of the church in its first state, when its members
received the doctrine of Christ in its purity, and enjoyed the benefits and
blessings of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. This applies to the first century,
or during the lifetime of the apostles. See dates in the accompanying
diagram, showing the beginning and close of the seven periods.

charge did the Lord bring against them?

<p>
<q>Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because <hi rend='italic'>thou

<p>
<q>Unto the angel of the church in <hi rend='italic'>Smyrna</hi> write.</q>  Verse 8.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The meaning
of Smyrna is <emph>myrrh</emph>, or <emph>sweet-smelling savor</emph>,
and applies to the period of time when many of the saints of God suffered
martyrdom under pagan Rome.

<p>
<q>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold,
<hi rend='italic'>the devil shall cast some of you into prison</hi>, that ye may be tried;
and <hi rend='italic'>ye shall have tribulation ten days</hi>: be thou faithful unto
death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</q> Verse 10.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The most
severe of what is commonly known as <q>the ten
persecutions</q> under pagan Rome, began under the emperor Diocletian,
and continued from 303 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> to
<hi rend='smallcaps'>313 a.d.</hi>, a period of ten prophetic days.
</quote>

<p>
12. What name is given to the third state of the church?
</p>

<p>
<q>To the angel of the church in <hi rend='italic'>Pergamos</hi> write.</q> Verse 12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The meaning of Pergamos
is <emph>height</emph>, or <emph>elevation</emph>, and fitly
represents that period of the Christian church, beginning with the reign
of the emperor Constantine in 313 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>,
when the power which had put the
Christians to death espoused the cause of the church, and by rewards,
edicts, and promised promotions to office in the government, sought to induce
the people to become Christians, thus bringing a flood of worldliness
and corruption into the church. Many of the heathen rites and ceremonies
previously introduced into the Christian religion, including the heathen
festival, <emph>Sunday</emph> (sun's day), were then established by law, resulting in the
first day of the week taking the place of the Sabbath of the Bible.
</quote>

<p>
13. How was the faithfulness of this church commended?
</p>

<p>
<q>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where
Satan's seat is: and <hi rend='italic'>thou holdest fast My name, and hast not
denied My faith</hi>, even in those days wherein Antipas was My
faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</q>
Verse 13.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Antipas</hi>
comes from two Latin words, <hi rend='italic'>anti</hi>, opposed to, and
<hi rend='italic'>papas</hi>, father, or pope, and denotes a class of people who were
opposed to papal rule. Regarding <hi rend='italic'>Pergamos</hi>, see note on page
<ref target='Pg256'>256</ref>.
</quote>

<p>
14. What title was given to the fourth state of the church?
</p>

<p>
<q>Unto the angel of the church in <hi rend='italic'>Thyatira</hi> write.</q> Verse 18.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Thyatira means
<emph>song of labor</emph>, or <emph>sacrifice of contrition</emph>, and
points out the condition of God's people during the long, dark period of
1260 years, beginning with the establishment of papal supremacy in 538
<hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>, and closing with the downfall of that power in 1798. See
notes on page <ref target='Pg223'>223</ref>.
During that time, millions of the saints of God were put to death in
the most cruel manner that wicked men and demons could invent. Christ
referred to this time in His wonderful prophecy recorded in Matthew
24, in these words: <q>For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not
since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And
except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved:
but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.</q> The tribulation
of the 1260 years was cut short through the influence of the Reformation.
</quote>

<p>
15. What promise did God leave for these persecuted ones?
</p>

<p>
<q>But that which ye have already hold fast till I come. And
<pb n='283'/><anchor id='Pg283'/>
he that overcometh, and keepeth My words unto the end, <hi rend='italic'>to
him will I give power over the nations</hi>: and he shall rule them with
a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to
shivers: even as I received of My Father.</q> Verses 25-27.
</p>

<p>
16. By what name is the fifth state of the church addressed?
</p>

<p>
<q>Unto the angel of the church in <hi rend='italic'>Sardis</hi> write.</q> Rev. 3:1.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Sardis means <emph>song of joy</emph>,
or <emph>that which remains</emph>. A cause for
<emph>joy</emph> at that time was the fact that the great tribulation of the people of God
was at an end. It was only as a result of the Reformation that any of
God's people were left <emph>remaining</emph>. See Matt. 24:21, 22, and note under
question 14. The Sardis church continued from the close of the papal
power, 1798 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>, until the beginning of the great advent
movement in 1833, which was marked by the falling of the stars on November 13 of that
year, as foretold by Christ in Matt. 24:29.
</quote>

<p>
17. What endearing title is given the sixth church?
</p>

<p>
<q>To the angel of the church in <hi rend='italic'>Philadelphia</hi> write.</q> Rev. 3:7.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Philadelphia means <emph>brotherly
love</emph>, and applies to the church
under the judgment-hour message. See page <ref target='Pg251'>251</ref>.
</quote>

<p>
18. What words to this church show the second advent near?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Behold, I come quickly</hi>: hold fast that which thou hast, that
no man take thy crown.</q> Verse 11.
</p>

<p>
19. What is Christ's message to the last church?
</p>

<p>
<q>Unto the angel of the church of the <hi rend='italic'>Laodiceans</hi> write;
... I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor
hot.... Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased in
goods, and have need of nothing; ... I counsel thee to
buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich;
and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed.... As
many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore,
and repent.</q> Verses 14-19.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Laodicea signifies
<emph>the judging of the people</emph>, or, according to
Cruden, a <emph>just people</emph>. This church exists in the time of the judgment
and the proclamation of the final warning messages preceding Christ's
second coming. See Rev. 14:6-16, and readings on cages 251-263. This
is a time of great profession, with but little vital godliness and true piety.
</quote>

<p>
20. What encouragement is given to heed this message?
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear
My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup
with him, and he with Me.</q> Verse 20.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The pointed,
searching messages to the seven churches contain
most important lessons of admonition, encouragement, and warning
for all Christians in all ages. The seven promises to the overcomer found
in this line of prophecy (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26-28; 3:5, 12, 21), with the
eighth or universal promise recorded in Rev. 21:7, form a galaxy of promises
as precious, as comforting, and as inspiring as any recorded in the Scriptures.

  </figure>
</p>

<p>
1. What did John the revelator see in the right hand of
Him who sat on the throne?
</p>

<p>
<q>And I saw in the right hand of Him that sat on the throne
<hi rend='italic'>a book</hi> written within, and
on the back side <hi rend='italic'>sealed with seven
seals</hi>.</q> Rev. 5:1.
</p>

<p>
2. What did the Lamb do with this book?
</p>

<p>
<q>And He came and took the book out of the right hand of
Him that sat on the throne.</q> Verse 7.
</p>

<p>
3. Why was Christ declared worthy to open these seals?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals
thereof: <hi rend='italic'>for Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by Thy
blood</hi> out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation.</q>
Verse 9.
</p>

<p>
4. What was shown upon the opening of the first seal?
</p>

<p>
<q>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, ...
<hi rend='italic'>a white horse</hi>: and He that sat on him had a bow; and a crown
was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to
conquer.</q> Rev. 6:1, 2.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The number
<hi rend='italic'>seven</hi> in the Scriptures denotes completion or
perfection. The seven seals embrace the whole of a class of events in
which is narrated the history of the church from the beginning of the
Christian era to the second coming of Christ. The white horse, with his
rider going forth to conquer, fitly represents the early Christian church in
its purity, going into all the world with the gospel message of salvation.
</quote>

<pb n='285'/><anchor id='Pg285'/>

<p>
5. What appeared upon the opening of the second seal?
</p>

<p>
<q>And when He had opened the second seal, ... there
went out <hi rend='italic'>another horse that was red</hi>: and power was given to him
that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they
should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great
sword.</q> Verses 3, 4.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;As whiteness
in the first horse denoted the purity of the
gospel which its rider propagated, so the color of the second horse would
show that corruption had begun to creep in when this symbol applies.
It is true that such a state of things did succeed the apostolic church.
Speaking of the second century, Wharey, in his <q>Church History,</q> page
39, says: <q>Christianity began already to wear the garb of heathenism.
The seeds of most of those errors that afterwards so entirely overran the
church, marred its beauty, and tarnished its glory, were already beginning
to take root.</q> Worldliness came in. The church sought alliance with
the secular power, and trouble and commotion were the result. This
symbol extends from the close of the first century to the time of Constantine,
when a complete union of church and state was effected.
</quote>

<p>
6. What was the color of the symbol under the third seal?
</p>

<p>
<q>When He had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast
say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo <hi rend='italic'>a black horse</hi>; and he
that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</q> Verse 5.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
<q>black</q> horse fitly represents the spiritual darkness that
characterized the church from the time of Constantine till the establishment
of papal supremacy in 538 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> Of the condition of things in the
fourth century, Wharey (page 54) says: <q>Christianity had now become
popular, and a large proportion, perhaps a large majority, of those who
embraced it, only assumed the name, received the rite of baptism, and conformed
to some of the external ceremonies of the church, while at heart
and in moral character they were as much heathen as they were before.
Error and corruption now came in upon the church like a flood.</q>
</quote>

<p>
7. What were the color and character of the fourth symbol?
</p>

<p>
<q>And when He had opened the fourth seal, ... behold
<hi rend='italic'>a pale horse</hi>: and his
name that sat on him was <hi rend='italic'>Death</hi>, and
<hi rend='italic'>Hell</hi> [Greek, <hi rend='italic'>Hades</hi>,
the <hi rend='italic'>grave</hi>] <hi rend='italic'>followed with him</hi>. And power was
given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, <hi rend='italic'>to kill with
sword</hi>, and with <hi rend='italic'>hunger</hi>, and
with <hi rend='italic'>death</hi>, and with the <hi rend='italic'>beasts of
the earth</hi>.</q> Verses 7, 8.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This is
an unnatural color for a horse. The original denotes
the <emph>pale</emph> or <emph>yellowish</emph>
color seen in blighted plants. The symbol evidently
refers to the work of persecution and death carried on by the Roman
Church against the people of God from the time of the beginning of papal
supremacy in 538 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> to the time when the Reformers commenced
their work of exposing the true character of the Papacy, and a check was placed
upon this work of death.
</quote>

<p>
8. On opening the fifth seal, what was seen under the altar?
</p>

<pb n='286'/><anchor id='Pg286'/>

<p>
<q>And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the
altar <hi rend='italic'>the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for
the testimony which they held</hi>.</q> Verse 9.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;When the Reformers exposed
the work of the Papacy, it was
then called to mind how many martyrs had been slain for their faith.
</quote>

<p>
9. What were these martyrs represented as doing?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>they cried with a loud voice</hi>, saying, How long, O Lord,
holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on
them that dwell on the earth?</q> Verse 10.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The cruel
treatment which they had received cried for vengeance,
just as Abel's blood cried to God from the ground. Gen. 4:10.
They were not in heaven, but under the altar on which they had been slain.
On this point Dr. Adam Clarke says: <q>The altar is upon earth, not in
heaven.</q> See note under next question.
</quote>

<p>
10. What was given these martyrs?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>white robes were given unto every one of them</hi>; and it
was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season,
until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should
be killed as they were, should be fulfilled [have fulfilled their
course, R. V.].</q> Verse 11.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;These had
been slain during the hundreds of years covered
by the preceding seal. Their persecutors, most of them, at least, had died.
And if they had at death passed to their punishment, as is by some supposed,
why should the martyred ones still importune for their punishment? In
this, as in other parts of the Bible, the figure of personification is used,
in which inanimate objects are represented as alive and speaking, and
things that are not as though they were. See Judges 9:8-15; Heb. 2:11;
Rom. 4:17. These martyrs had gone down as heretics under the darkness
and superstition of the preceding seal, covered with ignominy and shame.
Now, in the light of the Reformation, their true character appears, and they
are seen to have been righteous, and hence are given <q>white robes.</q> <q>The
fine linen [white robes] is the righteousness of saints.</q> Rev. 19:8. Righteousness
is ascribed to them; and when they have rested a little longer

<q>And I beheld when He had opened the sixth seal, and, lo,
there was <hi rend='italic'>a great earthquake</hi>.</q> Verse 12, first part.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This
doubtless refers to the great earthquake of Nov. 1, 1755,
commonly known as the Lisbon earthquake, the effects of which were felt
over an area of 4,000,000 square miles. Lisbon, Portugal, a city containing
150,000 inhabitants, was almost entirely destroyed. The shock of the
earthquake, says Mr. Sears, in his <q>Wonders of the World,</q> page 200,
<q>was instantly followed by the fall of every church and convent, almost
all the large public buildings, and one fourth of the houses. In about two
hours afterward, fires broke out in different quarters, and raged with such
<pb n='287'/><anchor id='Pg287'/>
violence for the space of nearly three days that the city was completely
desolated. The earthquake happened on a holy day, when the churches
and convents were full of people, very few of whom escaped....
The terror of the people was beyond description. Nobody wept: it was
beyond tears. They ran hither and thither, delirious with horror and
astonishment, beating their faces and breasts, crying,
<q><hi rend='italic'>Misericordia! the
world's at an end!</hi></q> Mothers forgot their children, and ran about loaded
with crucifixed images. Unfortunately, many ran to the churches for
protection; but in vain was the sacrament exposed; in vain did the poor
creatures embrace the altars; images, priests, and people were buried in
one common ruin.... Ninety thousand persons are supposed to
have been lost on that fatal day.</q>

A contributor, writing for the <hi rend='italic'>Journal of Commerce</hi> of Nov. 14,
1833, in regard to the falling stars of Nov. 13, 1833, said: <q>Were I to hunt
through nature for a simile, I could not find one so apt to illustrate the
appearance of the heavens as that which St. John uses in the prophecy.
The falling stars did not come as if from several trees shaken, but as from
<emph>one</emph>; those which appeared in the east, fell toward the east; those which
appeared in the west, fell toward the west; and those which appeared in the
south, fell toward the south. And they fell not as the <emph>ripe</emph> fruit
falls,&mdash;far from it,&mdash;but they flew, they were <emph>cast</emph>, like the
unripe fruit which at first refuses to leave the branch; and when, under a violent
pressure, it does break its hold, it flies swiftly, <emph>straight</emph> off,
descending; and in the multitude falling, some cross the track of others, as they are
thrown with more or less force; but each one falls on its own side of the tree.</q> See

<q>And <hi rend='italic'>the heaven departed as a scroll</hi> when it is rolled together;

and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</q>
Verse 14.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This event
is still future, and will take place in connection
with Christ's second coming. We are now standing between the two
events,&mdash;the last of the signs in the heavens, and the parting of the heavens
and removal of earthly things out of their places. The great signs here
mentioned which mark the approach of Christ's second coming and the
dissolution of all earthly things, are all in the past, and the world awaits the
sound of the last trump as the closing scene in earth's drama.

<p>
<q>And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the
rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every
bondman, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens and
in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains and
rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth

16. After the sealing work brought to view in Revelation 7,
which takes place under the sixth seal, how is the seventh seal
introduced?
</p>

<p>
<q>And when He had opened the seventh seal, <hi rend='italic'>there was silence
in heaven</hi> about the space of half an hour.</q> Rev. 8:1.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
sixth seal introduced the events connected with the
second coming of Christ. The seventh seal most naturally, therefore,
would refer to that event, or to some accompanying result of it. When
Christ comes, all the holy angels will accompany Him (Matt. 25:31); and it
follows that silence will necessarily, therefore, reign in heaven during their
absence. A half-hour of prophetic time would be about seven days. The
seven seals, therefore, bring us down to the second coming of Christ.

1. Following the seven seals, under what symbols was the
next series of thrilling events shown the apostle John?
</p>

<p>
<q>And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to
them were given <hi rend='italic'>seven trumpets</hi>.</q> Rev. 8:2.
</p>

<p>
2. With what do these trumpets deal?
</p>

<p>
With the wars, commotions, and political upheavals which
result in the breaking up and downfall of the Roman Empire,&mdash;the
first four with the downfall of Western Rome, the fifth
and sixth with the downfall of Eastern Rome, and the seventh
with the final downfall of Rome in its broadest sense, or all the
kingdoms of the world. See Revelation 8 and 9 and 11:14-19.
A trumpet is a symbol of war. Jer. 4:19, 20; Joel 2:1-11.
</p>

<p>
3. Under what figures is the first trumpet described?
</p>

<p>
<q>The first angel sounded, and there followed
<hi rend='italic'>hail</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>fire</hi>
mingled with <hi rend='italic'>blood</hi>, and they were cast upon the earth: and the
third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was
burnt up.</q> Rev. 8:7.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;<q>Twice, at
least, before the Roman Empire became divided
permanently into the two parts, the Eastern and the Western, there was a
tripartite division of the empire. The first
occurred 311 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>, when it was
divided between Constantine, Licinius, and Maximin;
the other, 337 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>,
on the death of Constantine, when it was divided between his three sons,
Constantine, Constans, and Constantius.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Albert

This trumpet describes the first great invasion upon Western or ancient
Rome, by the Goths, under Alaric, from 395
<hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> to 410 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> In 408 he
descended upon Italy, the middle <q>third part,</q> pillaging and burning
cities, and slaughtering their inhabitants. Says Gibbon, in his <q>Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire,</q> chapter 33, closing sentence, <q>The union
of the Roman Empire was dissolved; its genius was humbled in the dust;
and armies of unknown barbarians, issuing from the frozen regions of the
North, had established their victorious reign over the fairest provinces of
Europe and Africa.</q>

<p>
<q>And the second angel sounded, and as it were <hi rend='italic'>a great mountain

under the terrible Genseric&mdash;first of Africa and later of Italy&mdash;from 428

conquests were largely by sea. In a single night, near
Carthage, he destroyed, by fire and sword, more than half of the Roman
fleet, consisting of 1,113 ships and over 100,000 men. See Gibbon's

<p>
<q>And the third angel sounded, and <hi rend='italic'>there fell a great star
from heaven, burning as it were a lamp</hi>, and it fell upon the third
part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; and the
name of the star is called <hi rend='italic'>Wormwood</hi>: and the third part of the
waters became wormwood; <hi rend='italic'>and many men died of the waters</hi>,

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;The
harassing invasions and conquests of Attila, the Hun,
are foretold here. His conquests were characterized by fire; sword, and
pillage along the Rhine, in Gaul, and northern Italy. He claimed descent
from Nimrod, styled himself the <q>Scourge of God</q> and the <q>Dread of the
World,</q> and boasted that grass would never grow again where his horse
had trod. His greatest battle was at Chalons,
in Gaul, 451 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>, where of
his 700,000 men from 100,000 to 300,000 are said to have been left dead
on the field. See Gibbon's Rome, chapter 35, and <q>Fifteen Decisive
Battles of the World,</q> by Sir Edward Creasy, chapter 6.
</p>

<p>
Says Gibbon (chapter 34), <q>In the reign of Attila, the Huns again
became the terror of the world;</q> and he proceeds to describe <q>the character

<p>
<q>And the fourth angel sounded, and <hi rend='italic'>the third part of the sun

8. After the fall of Western Rome, what power in the East
arose to harass and overrun the Roman world, East and West?
</p>

<p>
Mohammedanism, commonly known as the Turkish or Ottoman
power, which arose in Arabia, with Mohammed, in 622 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>
</p>

<p>
9. How is the fifth trumpet, or first woe, introduced?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw <hi rend='italic'>a star fall from
heaven unto the earth</hi>: and to him was given the key of the bottomless
pit. And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a
smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; <hi rend='italic'>and the
sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit</hi>.
And there came out of the smoke <hi rend='italic'>locusts</hi> upon the earth: and unto
them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have
power.</q> Rev. 9:1-3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;Attila
is symbolized by the star of the third trumpet (Rev.
8:10, 11); Mohammed, by the star of this trumpet. The bottomless pit
doubtless refers to the wastes of the Arabian desert, from which came forth
<pb n='292'/><anchor id='Pg292'/>
the Mohammedans, or Saracens of Arabia, like swarms of locusts. The
darkening caused by the smoke from this pit fitly represents the spread
of Mohammedanism and its doctrines over Asia, Africa, and portions of
Europe. Their power as scorpions is strikingly seen in their vigorous and
speedy attacks upon, and overthrow of, their enemies.
</p>

<p>
<q>Over a large part of Spain, over north Africa, Egypt, Syria, Babylonia,
Persia, north India, and portions of Central Asia were spread&mdash;to

<p>
<q>And it was commanded them that they should not hurt
the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree;
but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.</q>
Verse 4.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;When
the Arabian tribes were gathered for the conquest
of Syria, 633 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>, the
caliph Abu-Bekr, the successor of Mohammed, instructed
the chiefs of his army not to allow their victory to be <q>stained
with the blood of women and children;</q> to <q>destroy no palm-trees, nor
burn any fields of corn;</q> to <q>cut down no fruit-trees, nor do any mischief to
cattle;</q> and to spare those religious persons <q>who live retired in monasteries,
and propose to themselves to serve God in that way;</q> but, he said,
<q>you will find another sort of people that belong to the synagogue of Satan,
who have shaven crowns: be sure you cleave their skulls and give them no
quarter till they either turn Mohammedan or pay tribute.</q> In this,
Mohammedanism, itself a false religion, is revealed as a scourge to apostate
Christianity.
</p>

<p>
<q>In a short time they [the Mohammedan Saracens] had taken from the
Aryans all the principal old Semitic lands,&mdash;Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia,

11. What were these locusts said to have over them?
</p>

<p>
<q>And they had <hi rend='italic'>a king</hi> over them, which is the angel of the
bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon,
but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon [margin, a
destroyer].</q> Verse 11.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;For hundreds of years the Mohammedans and invading
Tartar tribes, like the locusts (Prov. 30:27), had no general government
or king over them, but were divided into bands, or factions, under separate
leaders. But in the twelfth century Temuljin, king of the Mongols, or
Moguls, who is described as <q>the most terrible scourge that ever afflicted
the human race,</q> built up an empire <q>at the cost,</q> it is estimated, says
Myers in his <q>General History,</q> page 461, of <q>fifty thousand cities and
towns and five million lives.</q> This was followed by the more permanent
Tartar empire founded by Othman a century later, commonly known as the
Ottoman Empire, and ruled by the sultan.
</p>

<p>
From the first, the great characteristic of the Turkish government has
been that of a <q>destroyer.</q> Speaking of a war by the Turks upon the
Byzantine Empire in 1050, Gibbon (chapter 57) says: <q>The myriads of
Turkish horse overspread a frontier of six hundred miles from Tauris to
Erzeroum, and the blood of one hundred and thirty thousand Christians
was a grateful sacrifice to the Arabian prophet.</q>
</p>

<pb n='293'/><anchor id='Pg293'/>

<p>
In 1058 the Turks wrested the Holy Land from the Saracens, desecrated
the holy places, and treated the pilgrims to Jerusalem with cruelty.
This brought on the nine unsuccessful crusades of the next two centuries
for the recovery of the Holy Land.

growth of the monster.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>Decline

A Bible month consists of thirty days; five months would be 150 days.
Allowing a day for a year, 150 years from July 27, 1299, would reach to
July 27, 1449. During this period the Turks were engaged in almost
constant warfare with the Greek Empire, and yet without conquering it.

<p>
14. What command is given under the sixth trumpet?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the
four horns of the golden altar which is before God, saying to the
sixth angel which had the trumpet, <hi rend='italic'>Loose the four angels which
are bound in the great river Euphrates</hi>.</q> Verses 13, 14.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

angels are understood to refer to the four leading
Turkish sultanies&mdash;Aleppo, Iconium, Damascus, and Bagdad&mdash;of
which the Ottoman Empire was composed, situated in the country watered
by the river Euphrates.
</p>

<p>
As a striking parallel it may be noted that under the sixth plague
(Rev. 16:12-16), the four angels of Rev. 7:1-3 will loose the winds of war,
the waters of the river Euphrates (the Turkish Empire) will be dried up,
and the armies of the nations will assemble for the battle of Armageddon.

year 1453, Mohammed II, the Great, sultan of the
Ottomans, laid siege to the capital [Constantinople], with an army of over
200,000 men. After a short investment, the place was taken by storm.
The cross, which since the time of Constantine the Great had surmounted
the dome of St. Sophia, was replaced by the crescent, which remains to

Thus Constantinople, the eastern seat of the Roman Empire since the
days of Constantine, was captured by the Turks.
</p>

<p>
Reference also seems to be made here to the use of firearms, which
began to be employed by the Turks toward the close of the thirteenth
century, and which, discharged from horseback, would give the appearance
of fire and smoke issuing from the horses' mouths. In the battle of Armageddon,
to which allusion may here be made, an army of <q>twice ten
thousand times ten thousand,</q> or two hundred million, will doubtless be
assembled.

</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;An hour
in prophetic time is equal to fifteen days; a day
stands for a year, a month for thirty years, a year for 360 years. Added
together, these amount to 391 years and fifteen days, the time allotted for
the Ottoman supremacy. Commencing July 27, 1449, the date of the close
of the fifth trumpet, this period would end Aug. 11, 1840. In exact fulfilment
of the words of inspiration, this date marks the fall of the Ottoman
Empire as an independent power. His empire wasted beyond hope of recovery
in a war with Mohammed Ali, pasha of Egypt, the sultan of Turkey
submitted to the dictates of the then four great powers of Europe, and his
minister, Rifat Bey, on that very day, Aug. 11, 1840, reached Alexandria,
bearing, not the sultan's ultimatum, but that of the powers, to place in
the hands of the rebellious pasha. Since then Turkey has existed
only by the help or sufferance of the great powers of Europe, and has commonly
been referred to as <q>the Sick Man of the East.</q>

</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;The closing
scenes of this world's history and the judgment
are clearly brought to view here. Ever since the loss of independence by
the Ottoman Empire in 1840, the nations have been preparing for war as
never before, in view of international complications and a world war which
all fear is inevitable upon the dissolution of Turkey and the final disposition
of its territory. Towering above all others, the Eastern question has been
the one of paramount concern to them.
</p>

<p>
The investigative judgment began in heaven in 1844, at the close of
the prophetic period of 2300 days. See readings on pages
<ref target='Pg230'>230-253</ref>. When
this is finished, the time of reward will have arrived, the end will have
come, and the saints will themselves sit in judgment. See Rev. 20:4;
1 Cor. 6:1-3.

<p>
22. What scene in heaven was presented to the prophet
as the seventh trumpet was about to sound?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>the temple of God was opened in heaven</hi>, and there was
seen in His temple <hi rend='italic'>the ark of
His testament</hi>: and there were lightnings,
and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and
great hail.</q> Rev. 11:19.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;This
forcibly calls attention to the closing work of Christ
in the second apartment, or most holy place, of the sanctuary in heaven,
which began in 1844. See readings referred to in preceding note. The
reference to the ark of God's testament is a forcible reminder also of that
which is to be the standard in the judgment,&mdash;the law of God, or ten commandments.
See Eccl. 12:13, 14; Rom. 2:12, 13; James 2:8-12.
</p>

<p>
From its closing words&mdash;the reference to <q>great hail</q>&mdash;the seventh
trumpet evidently embraces the seven last plagues (see Rev. 16:17, 18);
and from its opening words&mdash;<q>the kingdoms of this world are become the
kingdoms of our Lord</q>&mdash;it marks the setting up of God's everlasting
kingdom.

<p>
1. What, briefly stated, is the Eastern question?
</p>

<p>
The driving out of Turkey from Europe, and the final extinction
of the Turkish Empire, with the world-embracing
events that follow. It has been otherwise described as <q>the
driving of the Turk into Asia, and a scramble for his territory.</q>
</p>

<p>
2. What scriptures are devoted to the Turkish power?
</p>

<p>
Dan. 11:40-45; Revelation 9; and Rev. 16:12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In the
eleventh chapter of Daniel, Turkey is dealt with
under the title of the <q>king of the north;</q> in Revelation 9, under the
sounding of the fifth and sixth <q>trumpets;</q> and in Revelation 16, under
the symbol of the drying up of the water of the chief river of the Turkish
Asiatic possessions, <q>the great river Euphrates.</q> The actual drying up
of the river Euphrates was the signal for the overthrow of ancient Babylon.
</quote>

<p>
3. When did Turkey take Constantinople, and thus the
northern division of ancient Greece and Rome?
</p>

<p>
In <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> 1453, under Mohammed II. See pages
<ref target='Pg293'>293</ref>, <ref target='Pg294'>294</ref>.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;After the
death of Alexander the Great, the Grecian Empire
was divided by his four leading generals, Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus,
and Ptolemy, into four parts,&mdash;east, west, north, and south,&mdash;the first
three of which were shortly afterward absorbed into one kingdom, the
kingdom of the north, Egypt remaining the king, or kingdom, of the south.
In the breaking up of the Roman Empire, the Turks gained possession
of the Holy Land in <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>
1058, and finally of Constantinople, and considerable
portions of eastern Europe,&mdash;the kingdom of the north,&mdash;in 1453, to
which, with varying fortunes and shrinking geographical boundaries, it has
held ever since.
</quote>

<p>
4. How has Turkey been regarded by European nations?
</p>

<pb n='297'/><anchor id='Pg297'/>

<p>
<q>The Turks have ever remained quite insensible to the influences
of European civilization, and their government has been
a perfect blight and curse to the countries subject to their rule.
They have always been looked upon <hi rend='italic'>as intruders</hi> in Europe, and
their presence there has led to several of the most sanguinary
wars of modern times. Gradually they have been pushed out
from their European possessions, and the time is probably not very far distant
when they will be driven back across the Bosporus.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Myers's
<q>General History,</q> edition 1902, page 468.</hi>
</p>

<p>
5. When did the independence of Turkey cease?
</p>

<p>
In 1840, at the close of a two years' war between Turkey and
Egypt, when the fate of Turkey was placed in the hands of four
great powers of Europe,&mdash;England, Russia, Austria, and
Prussia. See page 294, under question 19.
</p>

<p>
6. What is one of the last predictions of the prophecy of
Daniel concerning the king of the north?
</p>

<p>
<q>But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble
him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and
utterly to make away many.</q> Dan. 11:44.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Upon this, Dr.
Adam Clarke, writing in 1825, said: <q>If the
Turkish power be understood, as in the preceding verses, it may mean that
the Persians on the <emph>east</emph> and the Russians on the <emph>north</emph> will at
some time greatly embarrass the Ottoman government.</q> Such indeed was the case,
and these conditions brought on the Crimean war of 1853-56, between
Russia and Turkey. In this war England and France came to the help of
Turkey, and prevented Russia from grasping Constantinople, her coveted
prize, and thus gaining access to the Dardanelles and the Mediterranean
and so possessing herself of the gateway of commerce between Europe
Asia. Without an outlet to the sea, Russia cannot be a strong naval
power. In his celebrated will, Peter the Great of Russia (1672-1725) admonished
his countrymen thus: <q>Take every possible means of gaining
Constantinople and the Indies, for,</q> said he, <q>he who rules there will be
the true sovereign of the world; excite war continually in Turkey and
Persia; ... get control of the sea by degrees; ... advance to the
Indies, which are the great depot of the world. Once there, we can do without
the gold of England.</q> The authenticity of this will has been questioned,
but it outlines a policy which Russia has quite faithfully pursued.
</quote>

<p>
7. What since 1840 has saved Turkey from complete overthrow?
</p>

<p>
The help and interference of various European powers.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;<q>It
is not too much to say that England has twice saved
Turkey from complete subjection since 1853. It is largely&mdash;mainly&mdash;due
to our action that she now exists at all as an independent power. On
both these occasions we dragged the powers of Europe along with us in
maintaining the Ottoman government.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Duke

</quote>

<p>
8. Why have these powers thus helped Turkey?
</p>

<pb n='298'/><anchor id='Pg298'/>

<p>
Not from love for Turkey, but for fear of the international
complications that its downfall might entail.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;In his
Mansion House speech, Nov. 9, 1895, Lord Salisbury,
responding to a wide-spread demand for the overthrow of the Turkish
power, said: <q>Turkey is in that remarkable condition that it has now
stood for half a century, mainly because the great powers of the world have
resolved that <emph>for the peace of Christendom it is necessary that the Ottoman
Empire should stand</emph>. They came to that conclusion nearly half a century
ago. I do not think they have altered it now. <emph>The danger</emph>, if the Ottoman
Empire fall, would not merely be the danger that would threaten the
territories of which that empire consists; <emph>it would be the danger that the fire
there lit should spread to other nations, and should involve all that is most
powerful and civilized in Europe in a dangerous and calamitous contest</emph>. That
was a danger that was present to the minds of our fathers when they resolved
to make the integrity and independence of the Ottoman Empire a
matter of European treaty, <emph>and that is a danger</emph>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>which has not passed
away</hi>.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The Balkan, or Near Eastern, question has been one of the most
complicated political problems of the world's history for half a century.

diplomacy.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>American Review

end, and none shall help him</hi>.</q> Dan. 11:45.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;It would

the followers of Islam and the believers in the Christian religion.
In this place, many Bible students believe, Turkey will come to her end in

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;For years
the drying-up process of the Turkish Empire has

</p>

<p>
(1) In 1783 Turkey was compelled to surrender to Russia the territory
of the Crimea, including all the countries east of the Caspian Sea.
</p>

<p>
(2) In 1828 Greece secured her independence.
</p>

<p>
(3) In 1830 Algeria was ceded to France.
</p>

<p>
(4) In 1867 Turkey was forced to recognize the independence of Egypt.
</p>

<pb n='299'/><anchor id='Pg299'/>

<p>
(5) In the same year Turkey lost possession of Servia and Bosnia.
</p>

<p>
(6) In 1878 the Treaty of Berlin granted autonomous government to
Bulgaria, and independence to Roumelia, Roumania, and Montenegro.
</p>

<p>
(7) In 1912 Tripoli was taken over by Italy.
</p>

<p>
(8) In 1912 and 1913 the Balkan States and Greece dispossessed
Turkey of nearly all of her remaining territory in Europe.

</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Armageddon
consists of a great triangular plain in northern
Palestine, twelve by fifteen by eighteen miles, extending southeast from
Mt. Carmel, otherwise known as the plain of Esdraelon, or valley of Jezreel.
It has been the scene of many great battles, such as that of Gideon's overthrow
of the Midianites (Judges 6, 7), when <q>the Lord set every man's
sword against his fellow;</q> of Saul's defeat by the Philistines (1 Sam. 29:
1; 1 Chronicles 10); and of Josiah's defeat by Pharaoh Necho (2 Kings 23:29,
30; 2 Chron. 35:20-24): and, as this scripture indicates, it is the place
where, under the influence of evil spirits just preceding Christ's second
coming, the great armies of the world will be gathered for their final struggle
and utter destruction under the seventh plague.

14. When the king of the north comes to his end, what,
according to the prophecy, is to take place?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>at that time shall Michael stand up</hi>, the great Prince
which standeth for the children of thy people: and <hi rend='italic'>there shall be
a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation</hi> even
to that same time: and <hi rend='italic'>at that time thy people shall be delivered</hi>,
every one that shall be found written in the book.</q> Dan. 12:1.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
expression <q>stand up</q> occurs eight times in this line
of prophecy (Daniel 11 and 12), and in each case means <emph>to reign</emph>. See
Dan. 11:2, 3, 4, 7, 14, 20, 21; 12:1. Michael is Christ, as will be seen by
comparing Jude 9, 1 Thess. 4:16, and John 5:25. When the Turkish
Empire is brought to an end, therefore, the time will have come for Christ
to receive His kingdom (Luke 19:11-15), and begin His reign. This great
change will be ushered in by the downfall, not only of Turkey, but of all
nations (Rev. 11:15); by the time of trouble here spoken of; by the seven
<pb n='300'/><anchor id='Pg300'/>
last plagues described in Revelation 16; and by the deliverance of all God's
people,&mdash;those whose names are found written in the book of life (Rev.
3:5; 20:12),&mdash;which shows that probation and the investigative judgment
will then be past.

15. What will take place at this time?

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;At the
resurrection of Christ there was a special resurrection,
when many of the saints were raised from the dead, were seen of many, and
were taken to heaven with Christ at His ascension. Matt. 27:52, 53;
Eph. 4:8. So, just prior to Christ's second coming and the general resurrection
of the righteous, many of the sleeping saints, and some colossal sinners
(those that <q>pierced Him,</q> Rev. 1:7), it seems, will be raised to witness
His coming, and hear God's covenant of peace with His people.

This line of prophecy, therefore, brings us down to the resurrection of

</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
so-called Christian nations will not go to Palestine
merely to expel the Turks from the land. As in the crusades of the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries, the idea will be to rescue the Holy Land from the
Mohammedans, and make Jerusalem the center of a glorious kingdom, with
Christ as king. The Papacy itself, it is thought by some, will at this time
remove its seat to Jerusalem, and issue a great peace proclamation, directing
the nations to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into
pruning-hooks, and calling upon all to come up to the mountain of the
Lord, as described in Isa. 2:2-5 and Micah 4:1-5. Infatuated by the
doctrine of a temporal millennium, many nations will join in the call, and
say, <q>For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from
Jerusalem.</q> Isa. 2:3. But this will be but the signal for the battle of
Armageddon and the <q>sudden destruction</q> that is to overtake the world
and bring to an end the present order of things. See Rev. 19:17-21; Eze.
38:14-23; 39:17-22. Toward this consummation passing events all indicate

<p>
<q>And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since
there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy
people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written
in the book.</q> Dan. 12:1. See Eze. 7:15-19.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The seven last
plagues will be the most terrible scourges
ever visited upon man. As Ahab accused Elijah of being the cause of
Israel's calamities (1 Kings 18:17, 18), so, in the time of trouble, the wicked
and those who have departed from God will be enraged at the righteous,
will accuse them as being the cause of the plagues, and will seek to destroy
them as did Haman the Jews. See Esther 3:8-14. But God will miraculously
deliver His people at this time as He did then.

<p>
5. What will be the first plague, and upon whom will it fall?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the first went, and poured out his vial upon <hi rend='italic'>the earth</hi>;
and <hi rend='italic'>there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had
the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshiped his image</hi>.</q>
Rev. 16:2.
</p>

<p>
6. What will constitute the second plague?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the second angel poured out his vial upon <hi rend='italic'>the sea</hi>;
and <hi rend='italic'>it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul
died in the sea</hi>.</q> Verse 3.
</p>

<p>
7. What will be the third plague?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the third angel poured out his vial upon <hi rend='italic'>the rivers
and fountains of waters</hi>; and <hi rend='italic'>they became blood</hi>.</q> Verse 4.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The second
plague affects the sea. The third plague comes
closer to the habitations of men, and affects the land. The water supplies
are contaminated.
</quote>

<p>
8. Why, under these plagues, does the Lord give men blood
to drink?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets</hi>, and Thou
hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</q> Verse 6.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In this is
shown God's abhorrence of oppression and persecution.
The plagues are God's rebukes against colossal forms of sin.
</quote>

<p>
9. What will be the fourth plague?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon <hi rend='italic'>the sun</hi>;
and <hi rend='italic'>power was given unto him to scorch men with fire</hi>.</q> Verse 8.
See Joel 1:16-20.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Sun-worship
is the most ancient and wide-spread of all forms
of idolatry. In this plague God manifests His displeasure at this form of
idolatry. That which men have worshiped as a god, becomes a plague
and tormentor. Thus it was in the plagues of Egypt. Those things which
the Egyptians had worshiped became scourges to them instead of benefactors
<pb n='303'/><anchor id='Pg303'/>
and blessings. See <q>The Philosophy of the Plan of Salvation,</q>
by <q>An American Citizen,</q> chapter 3.
</quote>

<p>
10. Will even this terrible judgment lead men to repent?
</p>

<p>
<q>And men were scorched with great heat, and <hi rend='italic'>blasphemed
the name of God</hi>, which hath power over these plagues: and <hi rend='italic'>they
repented not to give Him glory</hi>.</q> Verse 9.
</p>

<p>
11. What will be the fifth plague?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon <hi rend='italic'>the seat of the
beast</hi>; and <hi rend='italic'>his kingdom was full of darkness</hi>; and they gnawed
their tongues for pain.</q> Verse 10.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This plague strikes
at the very seat of the great apostasy of
the latter days, the Papacy. It will doubtless be similar in effect to the
like plague in Egypt, which was a darkness that could <q>be felt.</q> Ex.
10:21-23. By this plague that iniquitous, haughty, and apostate spiritual
despotism which has set itself up as possessing all truth, and as being the
light of the world, is enshrouded in midnight darkness.
</quote>

<p>
12. What takes place under the sixth plague?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great
river <hi rend='italic'>Euphrates</hi>; and
<hi rend='italic'>the water thereof was dried up</hi>, that the way
of the kings of the East might be prepared.</q> Verse 12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This, we
understand, refers to the drying up of the Turkish
Empire by the great world powers preparatory to the battle of Armageddon.
See preceding reading.
</quote>

<p>
13. What gathers the nations to the battle of Armageddon?
</p>

<p>
<q>And I saw <hi rend='italic'>three unclean spirits</hi> like frogs come out of the
mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out
of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are <hi rend='italic'>the spirits of
devils</hi>, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the
earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of
that great day of God Almighty.... And he gathered
them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.</q>
Verses 13-16.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This scripture
shows that it is the spirit of Satan which
incites men to war, and explains why the great nations of the world are
now making such preparations for war. The dragon represents paganism;
the beast, the Papacy; and the false prophet, apostate Protestantism,&mdash;the
three great religious apostasies since the flood. The plain Esdraelon,
in southwestern Galilee, is the Armageddon here referred to. See note
on page <ref target='Pg099'>99</ref>.

<p>
14. At this time what event is imminent?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Behold, I come as a thief.</hi> Blessed is he that watcheth,

shame.</q> Verse 15.
</p>

<pb n='304'/><anchor id='Pg304'/>

<p>
15. What takes place under the seventh plague?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the seventh angel poured out his vial into <hi rend='italic'>the air</hi>....
And there were <hi rend='italic'>voices</hi>, and
<hi rend='italic'>thunders</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>lightnings</hi>;
and <hi rend='italic'>there was a great earthquake</hi>, such as was not since men were
upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. And
the great city was divided into three parts, <hi rend='italic'>and the cities of the
nations fell</hi>.</q> Verses 17-19.
</p>

<p>
16. What accompanies the earthquake?
</p>

<p>
<q>And there fell upon men <hi rend='italic'>a great hail out of heaven</hi>, every
stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God
because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding
great.</q> Verse 21. See Job 38:22, 23; Ps. 7:11-13.
</p>

<p>
17. What will the Lord be to His people at this time?
</p>

<p>
<q>The Lord also shall roar out of Zion, and utter His voice
from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake:
<hi rend='italic'>but the Lord will be the hope of His people, and the strength of the
children of Israel</hi>.</q> Joel 3:16. See Jer. 25:30, 31; Haggai 2:21;
Heb.12:26; Ps. 91:5-10.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;To prepare
His people and the world for these terrible judgments,
the Lord, as in the days of Noah, sends a warning message to every
nation, kindred, tongue, and people. See Rev. 14:6-10.
</quote>

<p>
18. Just before the pouring out of the plagues, what call
does God send to His people still in Babylon?
</p>

<p>
<q>And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, <hi rend='italic'>Come out
of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
receive not of her plagues</hi>. For her sins have reached unto
heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.</q> Rev.
18:4, 5. See Gen. 19:12-17; Jer. 51:6; and page 254.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;As
before the flood, many of God's people will doubtless
be laid away to rest shortly before the time of trouble. See Isa. 57:1;
Rev. 14:13. Referring to the time before the flood, an ancient book
says: <q>And all men who walked in the ways of the Lord, died in those
days, before the Lord brought the evil upon man which He had declared,
for this was from the Lord, that they should not see the evil which the
Lord spoke of concerning the sons of men.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Book
of Jasher 4:20.</hi> See
also chapter 5:21 of the same book.
</quote>

<p>
19. How suddenly will the plagues come upon modern
Babylon?
</p>

<p>
<q>Therefore shall her plagues come <hi rend='italic'>in one day</hi>, death, and
mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with
fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.... For
in <hi rend='italic'>one hour</hi> is thy judgment come.</q> Rev. 18:8-10.
</p>

<pb n='305'/><anchor id='Pg305'/>

<p>
20. What famine will come at this time upon those who have
rejected God's messages of mercy?
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that <hi rend='italic'>I will send a
famine in the land; not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water,
but of hearing the words of the Lord</hi>: and they shall wander from
sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run
to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.</q>
Amos 8:11, 12. See Luke 13:25; Prov. 1:24-26; Heb. 12:15-17.
</p>

<p>
21. What announcement is made under the seventh plague?
</p>

<p>
<q>And there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven,
from the throne, saying, <hi rend='italic'>It is done</hi>.</q> Rev. 16:17.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;God made man to bless him. Gen. 1:28. When His
blessings are abused, He withholds them, to teach men their source and
their proper use. Haggai 1:7-11. Judgments are sent that men may
<q>learn righteousness.</q> Isa. 25:9; 1 Kings 17:1. That men do not repent
under the plagues is no evidence that God has ceased to be merciful
and forgiving. They simply demonstrate that all have determined their
destiny, and that even the severest judgments of God will not move the
ungodly and impenitent to repentance.
</quote>

<p>
22. Just preceding Christ's second coming, what solemn
decree will go forth showing that the cases of all have been
decided?
</p>

<p>
<q>He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is
filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be
righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And,
behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give every
man according as his work shall be.</q> Rev. 22:11, 12.

<p>
<q>And I saw <hi rend='italic'>another mighty angel come down from heaven</hi>,
clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his

</p>

<p>
2. What did he have in his hand?
</p>

<p>
<q>And he had in his hand <hi rend='italic'>a little book open</hi>.</q> Verse 2.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The book

<p>
<q>And the angel which I saw ... lifted up his hand to
heaven, and sware by Him that liveth forever and ever, who

there should be time no longer</hi>.</q> Rev. 10:5, 6.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Not literal
nor probationary time, but prophetic time. The
2300-day period, which ended in 1844, must be alluded to here. See page
<ref target='Pg230'>230</ref>. No prophetic period in the Bible reaches beyond this.

4. What did the angel say was to be finished when the

</p>

<p>
<q>But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he

He hath declared to His servants the prophets.</q> Verse 7.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The mystery

The gospel, then, is to be finished as the seventh trumpet is about to sound.

<p>
5. What was John told to do with the little book?
</p>

<p>
<q>Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of

</p>

<pb n='307'/><anchor id='Pg307'/>

<p>
7. What does the apostle say of his experience in this matter?
</p>

<p>
<q>And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate
it up; and it was in my mouth <hi rend='italic'>sweet as honey</hi>: and as soon as I
had eaten it, my belly was <hi rend='italic'>bitter</hi>.</q> Verse 10.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In
this is most strikingly foretold the experience of those who
proclaimed the advent and judgment-hour message of 1843-44. Joyous
in the hope that Christ was coming then, like the early disciples regarding
His first advent (Luke 24:21; Acts 1:6, 7), they were bitterly disappointed,
and found that there was still a work on earth for them to do, as did the
early disciples following the crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of
Christ.

God had a still further message for the world?
</p>

<q>And he said unto me, <hi rend='italic'>Thou must prophesy again</hi> before
many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.</q> Verse 11.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The message of
Revelation 10 is the same as that of Rev. 14:6,
7; and the later messages of Rev. 14:8-12 answer to the instruction,

<head>Great Lines of Prophecy</head>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Great Image of Daniel 2.</hi> This prophecy, written
over twenty-five hundred years ago, is one of the greatest, briefest,
and most comprehensive prophecies in the Bible. Under
the symbol of a great metallic image, the rise and fall of nations
is outlined till the end of time and the setting up of God's everlasting
kingdom. See reading on page <ref target='Pg204'>204</ref>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Four Beasts of Daniel 7.</hi> This line of prophecy covers
the same ground as that of Daniel 2, but with additional features
introduced, especially that concerning the development and work
of the <q>little horn</q> power of the fourth beast, under which God's
people were to be oppressed until delivered and placed in possession
of the kingdom <q>forever and ever.</q> See reading on page
<ref target='Pg213'>213</ref>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The 2300 Days of Daniel 8.</hi> This prophecy, after tracing
the course of empire down through Medo-Persia, Greece, and
Rome, introduces the longest prophetic period in the Bible, reaching
from the beginning of the movement to restore and build
Jerusalem before Christ's first advent, to a similar work to be
performed by God's people in the last days preparatory to Christ's
second advent. See reading on page <ref target='Pg230'>230</ref>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Seventy Weeks of Daniel 9.</hi> This prophecy fixes the
date of the beginning of the 2300 days, of which the seventy
weeks are a part; definitely marks the time of Christ's first advent;
and briefly refers to the <q>consummation</q> and the overthrow
of the last of earthly kingdoms. See pages <ref target='Pg232'>232-236</ref>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Standing Up of Michael&mdash;Daniel 11 and 12.</hi> A literal
prophecy tracing the rise and fall of kings and kingdoms
from the early rulers of Persia in the sixth century <hi rend='smallcaps'>b.c.</hi>, to
the overthrow of Turkey, the <q>king of the north,</q> and the <q>standing
up,</q> or reign, of Michael, the Great Prince, which is Christ. See
page <ref target='Pg296'>296</ref>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>The Prophecies of the Revelation.</hi> These are supplemental
to the prophecies of Daniel. Under the Seven Churches,
the Seven Seals, the Seven Trumpets, the Great Red Dragon,
the Leopard Beast, and the Two-Horned Beast, the history and
experience of the church and of earthly kingdoms are traced during
the Christian era, to the end of the age. See pages <ref target='Pg301'>301-310</ref>.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='bold'>Christ's Great Prophecy.</hi> Christ's claim to being a prophet,
and the greatest of all prophets, is fully established by His prophecy
recorded in Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 21. In this He
depicts minutely the destruction of Jerusalem, the great tribulation
of the Dark Ages, and the signs that were to herald His
second coming. See pages <ref target='Pg311'>311-325</ref>.

<p>
1. How did Christ feel concerning Jerusalem, as He was
about to make His final visit to the city before His crucifixion?
</p>

<p>
<q>And when He was come near, He beheld the city, and <hi rend='italic'>wept
over it</hi>, saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this
thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they
are hid from thine eyes.</q> Luke 19:41, 42.
</p>

<p>
2. In what words did He foretell its destruction?
</p>

<p>
<q>For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall
cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee
in on every side, and shall lay thee even with the ground, and
thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one
stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy
visitation.</q> Verses 43, 44.
</p>

<p>
3. What pitiful appeal did He make to the impenitent city?
</p>

<p>
<q>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets,
and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I
have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth
her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!</q> Matt. 23:37.

<p>
4. As He was about to leave the temple, what did He say?

5. Hearing these words, what questions did the disciples ask?
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the
sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world?</q> Matt. 24:3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Christ's
answers to these questions are worthy of the most
careful study. The destruction of Jerusalem and the overthrow of the
Jewish nation attending it are a type of the final destruction of all the cities
of the world, and the overthrow of all nations. To some extent, therefore,
the descriptions of the two great events seem to be blended. When
Christ referred to the destruction of Jerusalem, His prophetic words reached
beyond that event to the final conflagration when the Lord shall rise out
of His place <q>to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity,</q> and
when the earth <q>shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.</q>
Isa. 26:21. Thus the entire discourse was given not for the early disciples
only, but for those who were to live during the closing scenes of the
world's history. During the discourse Christ did, however, give definite
signs, both of the destruction of Jerusalem and of His second coming.

<p>
6. In His reply, how did Christ indicate that neither the end
of the world nor of the Jewish nation was immediately at hand?
</p>

<p>
<q>Jesus answered and said unto them, <hi rend='italic'>Take heed that no man
deceive you</hi>. For many shall come in My name, saying, I am
Christ; and shall deceive many. And ye shall hear of wars and
rumors of wars: see that ye be not troubled: <hi rend='italic'>for all these things
must come to pass, but the end is not yet</hi>.</q> Verses 4-6.
</p>

<p>
7. What did He say of the wars, famines, pestilences, and
earthquakes which were to precede these events?
</p>

<p>
<q>All these are <hi rend='italic'>the beginning of sorrows</hi>.</q> Verse 8.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;These were to
precede and culminate in the great calamity
and overthrow, first, of Jerusalem, and finally of the whole world; for, as
already noted, the prophecy has a double application, first, to Jerusalem
and the Jewish nation, and secondly, to the whole world; the destruction of
Jerusalem for its rejection of Christ at His first advent being a type of the
destruction of the world at the end for its rejection of Christ in refusing to
heed the closing warning message sent by God to prepare the world for
Christ's second advent.
</quote>

<p>
8. In what language did Christ briefly describe the experiences
of His people previous to these calamities?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall
kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for My name's
sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one
another, and shall hate one another. And many false prophets
shall rise, and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall
abound, the love of many shall wax cold.</q> Verses 9-12.
</p>

<p>
9. Who did He say would be saved?
</p>

<p>
<q>But <hi rend='italic'>he that shall endure unto the end</hi>, the same shall be
saved.</q> Verse 13.
</p>

<pb n='313'/><anchor id='Pg313'/>

<p>
10. When did Christ say the end would come?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>this gospel of the
kingdom</hi> shall be <hi rend='italic'>preached in all the
world</hi> for a <hi rend='italic'>witness</hi> unto <hi rend='italic'>all
nations</hi>; and <hi rend='italic'>then shall the end come</hi>.</q>
Verse 14.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;In 60
<hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> Paul carried the gospel to Rome, which was then
the capital of the world. In <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>
64 he wrote of the saints of <q>Cæsar's
household</q> (Phil. 4:22); and the same year he says that the gospel had
been <q>preached to every creature which is under heaven.</q> Col. 1:23.
Very soon after this (October, 66 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>)
the Romans began their attacks
against Jerusalem; and three and one-half years later the overthrow of the
city and of the Jewish nation followed in the notable five months' siege
under Titus, in the spring and summer of 70 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>
</p>

<p>
Thus it was respecting the end of the Jewish nation; and thus it will be
in the end of the world as a whole. When the gospel, or good news, of
Christ's coming kingdom has been preached in all the world for a witness
unto all nations, the end of the world&mdash;of all nations&mdash;will come. As
the end of the Jewish nation came with overwhelming destruction, so will
come the end of the world. Armageddon, the battle of the nations, will be
fought, and the world will be swept with the besom of destruction under
the seven last plagues. See readings on pages <ref target='Pg206'>296</ref>,

<q>And <hi rend='italic'>when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies</hi>,
then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.</q> Luke 21:20.

</p>

<p>
<q>When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In October,
66 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>, when Cestius came against the city,
but for some unaccountable reason suddenly withdrew his army from it,
the Christians discerned in this the sign foretold by Christ, and fled. After
the departure of Cestius, Josephus, in his <q>Wars of the Jews,</q> chapter 20,
says that <q>many of the most eminent of the Jews swam away from the
city, as from a ship when it is going to sink.</q> It is a remarkable fact that
in the terrible siege which occurred under Titus three and one-half years
later, not a single Christian is known to have lost his life, while 1,100,000
Jews are said to have perished in it. Here is a most striking lesson on the
value and importance of studying and believing the prophecies, and giving
heed to the signs of the times. Those who believed what Christ had said,
and watched for the sign which He had foretold, were saved, while the unbelieving
perished. So it will be in the end of the world. The watchful
and believing will be delivered, while the careless and unbelieving will be
snared and taken. See Matt. 24:36-44; Luke 21:34-36; 1 Thess. 5:1-6.
</quote>

<p>
13. When the sign appeared, how suddenly were they to flee?
</p>

<p>
<q>Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take
anything out of his house: neither let him which is in the field
return back to take his clothes.</q> Verses 17, 18.
</p>

<pb n='314'/><anchor id='Pg314'/>

<p>
14. Besides telling His disciples when to flee, how did Christ
further show His solicitude and tender care for them?
</p>

<p>
<q>But pray ye that your flight be not in <hi rend='italic'>the winter</hi>, neither
on <hi rend='italic'>the Sabbath day</hi>.</q> Verse 20.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;The winter
would be an unfavorable time in which to flee,
entailing discomfort and hardship; and an attempt to flee on the Sabbath
day would doubtless have been met with difficulty, so false and pharisaical
were the notions of the Jews respecting the true character and object of
the Sabbath. See Matt. 12:1-14; Luke 13:14-17; Mark 1:32; 2:23-28;
John 5:10-18.
</p>

<p>
The prayers of Christ's followers were heard. Events were so over-*ruled
that neither Jews nor Romans hindered the flight of the Christians.
Upon the retreat of Cestius, the Jews pursued after his army, and the
Christians thus had an opportunity to leave the city. The country also
had been cleared of enemies who might have endeavored to intercept them.
At the time of this siege, the Jews were assembled at Jerusalem to keep
the Feast of Tabernacles, and thus the Christians of Judea were able to
escape unmolested, and in the autumn, a most favorable time for flight.

15. What trying experience did Christ then foretell?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>then shall be great tribulation</hi>, such as was not since
the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.</q>
Verse 21.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;In paragraph
4 of his preface to his <q>Wars of the Jews,</q>
Josephus, referring to the destruction of Jerusalem, says: <q>The misfortunes
of all men, from the beginning of the world, if they be compared to these
of the Jews, are not so considerable.</q> In this terrible calamity, the prophecy
of Moses recorded in Deut. 28:47-53, was literally fulfilled. He said,
<q>Thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy
daughters, ... in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine
enemies shall distress thee.</q> For an account of the fulfilment of this, see
Josephus's <q>Wars of the Jews,</q> book 6, chap. 3, par. 4.
</p>

<p>
Following the destruction of Jerusalem came the persecution of the
early Christians under the pagan emperors during the first three centuries
of the Christian era, that begun under Diocletian in 303
<hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>, and continuing
for ten years (Rev. 2:10), being the most bitter and extensive
persecution of God's people the world had yet witnessed. Following this
came the still greater and more terrible persecution of the saints during
the long centuries of papal supremacy, foretold in Dan. 7:25 and Rev.
12:6. All these tribulations occurred under either pagan or papal Rome.
</p>
</quote>

<p>
16. For whose sake did Christ say the period of papal persecution
would be shortened?
</p>

<p>
<q>And except those days should be shortened, there should
no flesh be saved: but <hi rend='italic'>for the elect's sake those days shall be
shortened</hi>.</q> Verse 22.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Through the
influence of the Reformation of the sixteenth
century, and the movements which grew out of it, the power of the Papacy
to enforce its decrees against those it pronounced heretics was gradually
lessened, until persecution ceased almost wholly about the middle of the
eighteenth century&mdash;the beginning of an epoch of freedom.

20. How is this expressed by Mark?
</p>

<p>
<q>But <hi rend='italic'>in those days, after that tribulation</hi>, the sun shall be

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;<q>The nineteenth
of May, 1780, was a remarkably dark day.
Candles were lighted in many houses. The birds were silent, and disappeared.
The fowls retired to roost. It was the general opinion that the
day of judgment was at hand. The legislature of Connecticut was in
session at Hartford, but being unable to transact business,

<q>In some places persons could not see to read common print in the

and became silent; fowls went to roost; cattle sought the barn-yard;
and candles were lighted in the houses. The obscuration began
about ten o'clock in the morning, and continued until the middle of the
next night, but with differences of degree and duration in different places....

Herschel, the great astronomer, says: <q>The dark day in Northern
America was one of those wonderful phenomena of nature which will
always be read with interest, but which philosophy is at a loss to explain.</q>
<pb n='321'/><anchor id='Pg321'/>
The darkness was not caused by any eclipse of the sun by the moon,
for the moon had fulled only the night before, and consequently was on the
opposite side of the earth from the sun.
</p>

<p>
<q>The darkness of the following evening was probably as deep and
dense as ever had been observed since the Almighty first gave birth to light;
it wanted only palpability to render it as extraordinary as that which overspread
the land of Egypt in the days of Moses. If every luminous body
in the universe had been shrouded in impenetrable shades, or struck out of
existence, it was thought the darkness could not have been more complete.

10. When was there a remarkable display of falling stars?
</p>

<p>
Nov. 13, 1833.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;The
celebrated astronomer and meteorologist, Professor
Olmsted, of Yale College, says: <q>Those who were so fortunate as to witness
the exhibition of shooting stars on the morning of Nov. 13, 1833,
probably saw the greatest display of celestial fireworks that has ever been
since the creation of the world, or at least within the annals covered by the
pages of history.... The extent of the shower of 1833 was such
as to cover no inconsiderable part of the earth's surface, from the middle
of the Atlantic on the east to the Pacific on the west; and from the northern
coast of South America to undefined regions among the British possessions
on the north the exhibition was visible, and everywhere presented nearly
the same appearance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>At Niagara the exhibition was especially brilliant, and probably no
spectacle so terribly grand and sublime was ever before beheld by man as
that of the firmament descending in fiery torrents over the dark and roaring
cataract.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>The American
Encyclopedia, edition 1881, article <q>Meteor.</q></hi>
</p>

<p>
Upon reading a statement that modern fireworks excel this greatest
exhibition of shooting stars, Mr. Clarkson, father of the former editors of
the paper from which the following quotation is made, and himself agricultural
editor of it, said: <q>The writer of that sentence did not witness the
glorious meteoric shower of November, 1833, when the display was so
much superior to any artistic display of fireworks that neither language nor
any element in nature can furnish comparisons. The comparison of the
sheet-iron thunder of the theaters to the electric display of Providence
when the heavens are all on fire, and the earth trembles, would be tolerable.
But the awful grandeur of the display on the night of the thirteenth of
November, 1833, which made the stoutest heart stand in awe, and the
most defiant infidel quake with fear, is never to be compared with the most
brilliant fireworks. Those who witnessed the meteoric shower named saw
the greatest display that man ever will see until the day that Peter speaks
of when the heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements shall
melt with fervent heat. The agricultural editor of the <hi rend='italic'>Register</hi>
was out alone with a team and load of lumber all night on that never-to-be-forgotten
night. And he cannot now consent to hear of human fireworks
being superior to that most grand and sublime spectacle ever before or
since beheld by man. Patent fireworks are no nearer this wonderful
phenomenon than a lightning-bug is equal to the
sun.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Iowa State Register,

Frederick A. Douglas, in his book <q>My Bondage and My Freedom,</q>
page 186, says: <q>I witnessed this gorgeous spectacle, and was struck with
awe. The air seemed filled with bright descending messengers from the
sky. It was about daybreak when I saw this sublime scene. It was not
without the suggestion at that moment that it might be <hi rend='italic'>the harbinger of
the coming of the Son of man</hi>; and in my state of mind I was prepared to
hail Him as my friend and deliverer. I had read that the stars shall fall
from heaven, and they were now falling.</q>
</p>

<p>
A single star appeared to the wise men, and directed them to the
Saviour, at His first advent. Myriads of stars have announced the nearness
of His second advent.
</p>

<p>
It will be seen that these signs produced the very impression that God
evidently intended that they should,&mdash;that the day of judgment, Christ's
coming, and the end of the world are near at hand.

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;The time

12:4, 9, and the reading <q>The Kingdom and Work of Antichrist,</q> page
218, under questions 5-8. Since 1798 there has been a most wonderful
increase of all kinds of knowledge, both scientific and religious. Men have
been <q>running to and fro</q> through both the world and the Word of God.
The prophecies of Daniel are now themselves understood. Since 1798 five
great Bible and tract societies have been organized; namely, the London
Religious Tract Society, the British and Foreign Bible Society, the American
Bible Society, the American Tract Society, and the International
Tract Society, besides many smaller societies of the same kind. From
these have gone forth to the world hundreds of millions of copies of the
Bible, and countless pages of tracts and pamphlets, disseminating knowledge
upon the truths of salvation. Besides these, millions of copies of
religious papers are being circulated annually in the various countries of
the world. Missions have been established in all parts of the world. All
this has been accomplished since 1798.

to a short period just preceding the end. During this time there was to be a

end: because it is yet for a time appointed</hi>.</q> Dan. 11:35.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The time of
the end, as shown by this text, was even then,
in the days of Daniel, an appointed time, in the mind of God. This is not
strange, when we learn that in the Scriptures both the judgment and the end
itself are said to be appointed times. Acts 17:31; Dan. 8:19. The close

they shall be given into his hand <hi rend='italic'>until a time and times and the

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;As shown in
the reading on <q>The Kingdom and Work of
Antichrist,</q> page 218, this expression, <q>a time and times and the dividing
of time,</q> represents 1260 years, which extend from the period 533-538
<hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>, the time of the decree of Emperor Justinian recognizing
the Pope as head of all the churches and the successful campaign against Arianism,
to the period 1793-98, when, as a result of the French Revolution, the
papal power received its deadly wound and the Pope was carried into captivity.
This, then, locates the beginning of <q>the time of the end</q> in 1798.
Up to that point the book of Daniel, as a whole, was to be closed up; in
other words, not understood by the people. But when the power that had
placed this embargo on the Word of God, and had tried to shut it away from
the people, was broken, then light of all kinds, Biblical, scientific, inventive,
and industrial, began to shine and penetrate in every direction.
</p>

<p>
It is a singular and striking fact that immediately following the overthrow
of the papal power in 1798, Bible societies, tract societies, and Sunday-schools
sprang up in large numbers. The London Religious Tract
Society was organized in 1799, the British and Foreign Bible Society in
1804, the American Bible Society in 1816, and the American Tract Society
in 1825. The Bible has now been translated into about four hundred and
fifty languages and dialects, and sent to every part of the globe. Before
that time access to the Bible was confined to comparatively few. Now the
humblest person may possess it, and is as free to read and study it as is
the most exalted in the land. A little more than one hundred years ago
there was not a Sunday-school in the world, the first one being organized
by Robert Raikes, at Gloucester, England, in 1784. Now there are more
than 285,000 such schools, with over 28,000,000 officers, teachers, and
pupils.

and a quarter ago knew nothing of steamships, steam and
electric railways, telegraphs, telephones, photographs, phonographs,
sewing-machines, anesthetics, submarine cables, linotypes,
monotypes, motion pictures, X-rays, aeroplanes, or
wireless telegraphy. Were they to be raised from the dead,
they would be as much astonished at all these things as would
the people of four thousand years ago.

It will be noticed that none of these inventions antedate 1798. Go
back a little over a century and we find the world about where it was in
the days of the patriarchs. For thousands of years there seemed to be
scarcely any advancement or improvement in knowledge. But suddenly
with the opening of the nineteenth century, the world awoke from its long
sleep, and a new era dawned,&mdash;the time of the end, when knowledge was
to be increased.

and the stars have fallen, as predicted by the Saviour knowledge has most
wonderfully increased, as stated by the angel to Daniel; and the gospel has
gone to nearly every kindred, tribe, and people in the world. Therefore

<p>
1. What is one reason why the last days were to be perilous?
</p>

<p>
<q>Men shall be <hi rend='italic'>lovers of their
own selves, covetous</hi>.</q> 2 Tim. 3:2.
</p>

<p>
2. When, according to prophecy, were men to amass great
wealth?
</p>

<p>
<q>Go to now, <hi rend='italic'>ye rich men</hi>, weep and howl for your miseries
that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your
garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered;
and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall
eat your flesh as it were fire. <hi rend='italic'>Ye have heaped treasure together
for the last days.</hi></q> James 5:1-3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;We have
reached the age of vast accumulations of wealth,
when there seems to be a mad rush for making money quickly, and the
millionaire and the multimillionaire are much in evidence. Speaking on
this subject, Rev. H. W. Bowman, in his work <q>War Between Capital and
Labor,</q> says: <q>Such colossal fortunes, such hoarding of treasures, such
combinations of wealth, with such rapid increase in poverty, were never
witnessed before. Our age alone fits the prophetic mold.</q>

<p>
3. Why did Christ, in the parable, reprove the man who
hid his talent?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I
<pb n='330'/><anchor id='Pg330'/>
reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:
<hi rend='italic'>thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers,
and then at my coming I should have received mine own with
usury</hi>.</q> Matt. 25:26, 27.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;<q>Servility
to wealth,</q> says J. S. Mill, <q>is a social curse.</q>
Vespasian spoke truly when he said, <q>Riches are well, if gotten well and
well spent;</q> and Peter Cooper likewise uttered a great truth when he said,
<q>A man of wealth is but a steward for the good of mankind.</q> James A.
Patten, the retired Chicago millionaire wheat broker, announcing his intention
to give away his fortune to charity, said: <q>I believe a man should
give away a good share of his wealth while he is living. He can't take a
dollar out of the world with him, although I know some men who seem to
believe they can. Personally, I mean to get rid of the most of my fortune.
I hope to help many charitable institutions before I die. I doubt the
advisability of leaving any great sum of money to one's children. Many
lives have been ruined by large bequests. The offspring of a rich man are
better off if they are required to hustle for
themselves.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Washington

<p>
4. What did Christ tell the rich young man to do?
</p>

<p>
<q>Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, <hi rend='italic'>go and sell
that thou hast, and give to the poor</hi>, and thou shalt have treasure
in heaven: and come and follow Me.</q> Matt. 19:21.
</p>

<p>
5. What, in the parable, did God say to the rich man who
thought to build larger barns in which to store his goods?
</p>

<p>
<q>But God said unto him, <hi rend='italic'>Thou fool, this night thy soul shall
be required of thee</hi>: then whose shall those things be, which thou
hast provided?</q> Luke 12:20.
</p>

<p>
6. How does James say the rich have lived?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton</hi>; ye
have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.</q> James
5:5.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This indicates
that they have lived in luxury and for pleasure,
quite heedless of the needs of the poor and of the great world about them.
They have lived simply to have a good time themselves, with no thought
of their responsibility to God or to their fellow men.

<p>
7. Who gives men the power to get wealth?
</p>

<p>
<q>But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for <hi rend='italic'>it is He
that giveth thee power to get wealth</hi>.</q> Deut. 8:18.
</p>

<p>
8. How does James say the rich have treated the just?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Ye have condemned and killed the just</hi>; and he doth not
resist you.</q> James 5:6.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;There is nothing
more rapacious and heartless than greed,
or covetousness. To obtain its ends, it disregards the rights, the welfare,
and even the lives of those affected by its merciless schemes and intrigues.
The righteous, or just, however, do not make forcible resistance to this
unjust treatment.

9. How have the rich defrauded the laborers?
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, <hi rend='italic'>the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your
fields, which is of you kept back by fraud</hi>, crieth: and the cries of
them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord
of sabaoth.</q> Verse 4.
</p>

<p>
10. Seeking a fair remuneration, what do many laborers do?
</p>

<p>
Form labor-unions, engage in strikes, boycotts, etc.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;While these means
may hold matters in check for a time,
and afford temporary relief, they cannot eradicate the evil, and bring about
a final solution. The evil is deep-seated; it lies in the heart; and nothing
but conversion&mdash;a change of the heart and of the affections&mdash;can eradicate
it. It is the sin of selfishness, or covetousness,&mdash;a failure to love one's
neighbor as oneself. The conflict between capital and labor is an inevitable
and an irrepressible conflict as long as sin and selfishness are in the world.
And near the end it becomes the most acute and intense, because then sin
comes to the full.
</quote>

<p>
11. Do the Scriptures indicate that there will be violence
manifested in this conflict?
</p>

<p>
<q>Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how
long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay! <hi rend='italic'>Shall

<q><hi rend='italic'>Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.</hi>

</p>

<p>
1. What promise did Christ make concerning His coming?
</p>

<p>
<q>Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe
also in Me. In My Father's house are many mansions: if it
were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for
you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, <hi rend='italic'>I will come again</hi>,
and receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be
also.</q> John 14:1-3.
</p>

<p>
2. Following the signs of His coming, what did Christ say
would take place?
</p>

<p>
<q>And then shall they see <hi rend='italic'>the Son of man coming in a cloud
with power and great glory</hi>.</q> Luke 21:27.
</p>

<p>
3. Will the world be prepared to meet Him?
</p>

<p>
<q>And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven:
and <hi rend='italic'>then shall all the tribes
of the earth mourn</hi>, and they shall see
the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and
great glory.</q> Matt. 24:30. <q>Behold, He cometh with clouds;
and every eye shall see Him, and they also which pierced Him:
and <hi rend='italic'>all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of Him</hi>.</q> Rev.
1:7.
</p>

<p>
4. Why will many not be prepared for this event?
</p>

<p>
<q>But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, <hi rend='italic'>My lord
delayeth his coming</hi>; and shall begin to smite his fellow servants,
<pb n='333'/><anchor id='Pg333'/>
and to eat and drink with the drunken; the lord of that servant
shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour
that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint
him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.</q> Matt. 24:48-51.
</p>

<p>
5. What will the world be doing when Christ comes?
</p>

<p>
<q>But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of
the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood
<hi rend='italic'>they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage</hi>,
until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not till
the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming
of the Son of man be.</q> Verses 37-39. <q>Likewise also as it
was in the days of Lot; <hi rend='italic'>they did eat, they drank, they bought, they
sold, they planted, they builded</hi>; but the same day that Lot went
out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed
them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the
Son of man is revealed.</q> Luke 17:28-30.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The idea is, not
that it is wrong in itself to eat, drink, marry,
buy, sell, plant, or build, but that men's minds will be so taken up with
these things that they will give little or no thought to the future life, and
make no plans or preparation to meet Jesus when He comes.
</quote>

<p>
6. Who is it that blinds men to the gospel of Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>In whom <hi rend='italic'>the god of this world</hi> hath blinded the minds of
them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of
Christ, which is the image of God, should shine unto them.</q>
2 Cor. 4:4.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;<q>To
my mind this precious doctrine&mdash;for such I must call
it&mdash;of the return of the Lord to this earth is taught in the New Testament
as clearly as any other doctrine in it; yet I was in the church fifteen or sixteen
years before I ever heard a sermon on it. There is hardly any church
that does not make a great deal of baptism; but in all of Paul's epistles I
believe baptism is spoken of only thirteen times, while it speaks about the
return of our Lord fifty times; and yet the church has had very little to say
about it. Now I can see a reason for this. The devil does not want us
to see this truth; for nothing would wake up the church so much. The
moment a man takes hold of the truth that Jesus Christ is coming back
again to receive His followers to Himself, this world loses its hold on him.
Gas stocks, and water stocks, and stocks in banks and railroads are of very
much less consequence to him then. His heart is free, and he looks for the
blessed appearing of his Lord, who, at His coming, will take him into His
blessed kingdom.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>The
Second Coming of Christ,</q> by D. L. Moody,
pages 6, 7.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<q><q>This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, <emph>shall so come
in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven</emph>,</q> is the parting promise of
Jesus to His disciples, communicated through the two men in white apparel,
as a cloud received Hun out of their sight. When after more than fifty
years in glory He breaks the silence and speaks once more in the Revelation
which He gave to His servant John, the post-ascension gospel which He
<pb n='334'/><anchor id='Pg334'/>
sends opens with, <q><emph>Behold, He cometh with clouds</emph>,</q> and closes with,
<q><emph>Surely I come quickly</emph>.</q> Considering the solemn emphasis thus laid upon
this doctrine, and considering the great prominence given to it throughout the
teaching of our Lord and of His apostles, how was it that for the first five
years of my pastoral life it had absolutely no place in my preaching? Undoubtedly,
the reason lay in the lack of early instruction. Of all the sermons
heard from childhood on, I do not remember listening to a single one
upon this subject.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>How Christ Came to

<p>
7. At His ascension, what assurance was given of Christ's
return?
</p>

<p>
<q>And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He
went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into
heaven? <hi rend='italic'>this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven,
shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven</hi>.</q>
Acts 1:10, 11.
</p>

<p>
8. How ancient is this doctrine of Christ's coming?
</p>

<p>
<q>And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of
these, saying, <hi rend='italic'>Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His
saints</hi>, to execute judgment upon all.</q> Jude 14, 15.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Seeking to cast
reflection upon modern believers in the advent
doctrine, a man in Hungary not long ago remarked to a colporteur of this
faith that he had heard that the first Adventist preacher is still living.
<q>Yes,</q> replied the colporteur, <q>the first Adventist preacher is still living,
yet the Adventist faith is thousands of years old. The Bible says that
Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, preached the coming of Christ in
glory and power, and Enoch is still living. He was translated to heaven
without seeing death, and will never die.</q>

<p>
9. What was Job's confidence concerning Christ's coming?
</p>

<p>
<q>For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall
stand at the latter day upon the earth: ... whom I shall
see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another;
though my reins be consumed within me.</q> Job 19:25-27.
</p>

<p>
10. How does David speak of Christ's coming?
</p>

<p>
<q>Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall
devour before Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round
about Him.</q> Ps. 50:3. <q>For He cometh, for He cometh to
judge the earth: He shall judge the world with righteousness,
and the people with His truth.</q> Ps. 96:13.
</p>

<p>
11. How does Paul give expression to this hope?
</p>

<p>
<q>For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we
look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.</q> Phil. 3:20.
<pb n='335'/><anchor id='Pg335'/>
<q>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of
the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.</q> Titus 2:13.
</p>

<p>
12. What is Peter's testimony regarding it?
</p>

<p>
<q>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when
we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of His majesty.</q> 2 Peter
1:16.
</p>

<p>
13. When are the saints to be like Jesus?
</p>

<p>
<q>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet
appear what we shall be: but we know that, <hi rend='italic'>when He shall
appear, we shall be like Him</hi>; for we shall see Him as He is.</q>
1 John 3:2.
</p>

<p>
14. What scriptures show that Christ's coming will be a
time of reward?
</p>

<p>
<q>For the Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father
with His angels; and <hi rend='italic'>then He shall reward every man according
to his works</hi>.</q> Matt. 16:27. <q>And, behold, I come quickly;
<hi rend='italic'>and My reward is with Me</hi>, to give every man according as his
work shall be.</q> Rev. 22:12.
</p>

<p>
15. To whom is salvation promised at Christ's appearing?
</p>

<p>
<q>So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and
<hi rend='italic'>unto them that look for Him</hi> shall He appear the second time without
sin unto salvation.</q> Heb. 9:28.
</p>

<p>
16. What influence has this hope upon the life?
</p>

<p>
<q>We know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him;
for we shall see Him as He is. And <hi rend='italic'>every man that hath this
hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is pure</hi>.</q> 1 John 3:2, 3.
</p>

<p>
17. To whom does Paul say a crown of righteousness is
promised?
</p>

<p>
<q>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure
is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished
my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for

</p>

<p>
18. What will the waiting ones say when Jesus comes?
</p>

<p>
<q>And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we
have waited for Him, and He will save us: this is the Lord; we

<p>
<q>And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts

will that he tarry <hi rend='italic'>till I come</hi>, what is that to thee?</q> John

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;From this it
is evident that the early disciples regarded
death and the coming of Christ as two separate events.
</p>

<p>
<q><q>Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the
Son of man cometh.</q> Some people say that means death; but the Word of
God does not say it means death. Death is our enemy, but our Lord hath
the keys of death; He has conquered death, hell, and the grave....
Christ is the Prince of Life; there is no death where He is; death flees at
His coming; dead bodies sprang to life when He touched them or spoke to
them. His coming is not death. He is the resurrection and the life.
When He sets up His kingdom, there is to be no death, but
life forevermore.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>The

<p>
<q>And when He had spoken these things, while they beheld,
He was taken up; and <hi rend='italic'>a cloud received Him out of their sight</hi>.
And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up,
behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also
said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?
this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, <hi rend='italic'>shall
so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven</hi>.</q> Acts
1:9-11.
</p>

<p>
5. How did Christ Himself say He would come?
</p>

<p>
<q>For the Son of man shall come <hi rend='italic'>in the glory of His Father
with His angels</hi>.</q> Matt. 16:27. <q>Then shall all the tribes
of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming
<hi rend='italic'>in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory</hi>.</q> Matt. 24:
30. <q>For whosoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words,
of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when <hi rend='italic'>He shall come in
His own glory, and in His Father's, and of the holy angels</hi>.</q> Luke
9:26.

</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, He cometh with clouds; and <hi rend='italic'>every eye shall see
Him</hi>, and they also which pierced Him.</q> Rev. 1:7.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Christ's second
coming will be as real as was His first, and
as visible as His ascension, and far more glorious. To spiritualize our
Lord's return is to pervert the obvious meaning of His promise, <q>I will
come again,</q> and nullify the whole plan of redemption; for the reward of
the faithful of all ages is to be given at this most glorious of all events.
</quote>

<p>
7. What wonderful demonstration will accompany the
Lord's coming?
</p>

<p>
<q>The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven <hi rend='italic'>with a shout,
with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God</hi>: and the
dead in Christ shall rise first.</q> 1 Thess. 4:16.
</p>

<p>
8. What warning has Christ given concerning false views
of the manner of His coming?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then if any man shall say unto you, <hi rend='italic'>Lo, here is Christ, or
there; believe it not</hi>. For there shall arise false Christs, and false
prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch
that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold,
I have told you before. Wherefore if they shall say unto
you, Behold, He is in the <hi rend='italic'>desert</hi>; go not forth: behold, He is in
the <hi rend='italic'>secret chambers</hi>; believe it not.</q> Matt. 24:23-26.
</p>

<p>
9. How visible is His coming to be?
</p>

<p>
<q>For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth
even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man
be.</q> Verse 27.

<q>We shall not all sleep, but <hi rend='italic'>we shall all be changed</hi>, in a

moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised <hi rend='italic'>incorruptible</hi>,
and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on

</p>

<p>
6. When are the saints to be like Jesus?

9. What promise is made to those who look for Him?

11. Have the worthies of old gone to their reward?
</p>

<p>
<q>And these all, having obtained a good report through
faith, <hi rend='italic'>received not the promise</hi>: God having provided some better
thing for us, <hi rend='italic'>that they without us should not be made perfect</hi>.</q>
Heb. 11:39, 40.

12. When did Paul expect to receive his crown?

<p>
<q>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me <hi rend='italic'>at that day</hi>:
and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.</q>

saints, to execute judgment upon all</hi>.</q> Jude 14, 15.

<p>
<q>When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the

    <head>The Resurrection Of Christ.
"I am He that liveth, and was dead; ...
and have the keys of hell and of death."
Rev. 1:18.</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
1. Concerning what should we not be ignorant?
</p>

<p>
<q>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, <hi rend='italic'>concerning
them which are asleep</hi>, that ye sorrow not, even as others
which have no hope.</q> 1 Thess. 4:13.
</p>

<p>
2. What is set forth as the basis for hope and comfort?
</p>

<p>
<q>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, <hi rend='italic'>even so them
also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him</hi>.</q> Verse 14.
</p>

<p>
3. When will this resurrection of the saints take place?
</p>

<p>
<q>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we
which are alive and remain unto <hi rend='italic'>the coming of the Lord</hi> shall not
prevent [precede] them which are asleep. <hi rend='italic'>For the Lord Himself
shall descend from heaven</hi> with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel,
and with the trump of God: <hi rend='italic'>and the dead in Christ shall
rise first</hi>.</q> Verses 15, 16.
</p>

<p>
4. What will then take place?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together
with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air:
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</q> Verse 17.
</p>

<p>
5. With what are we to comfort one another?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore comfort one another <hi rend='italic'>with these words</hi>.</q> Verse 18.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The hope
of a resurrection from the dead to a life immortal
is the great hope set forth in the gospel.
</quote>

<pb n='344'/><anchor id='Pg344'/>

<p>
6. Concerning what did Christ tell us not to marvel?
</p>

<p>
<q>Marvel not at this: for <hi rend='italic'>the hour is coming, in the which all
that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth</hi>;
they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they
that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</q> John
5:28, 29.
</p>

<p>
7. What is said of those embraced in the first resurrection?
</p>

<p>
<q>Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection:
on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be
priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand
years.</q> Rev. 20:6.
</p>

<p>
8. Upon what one fact does Paul base the Christian hope?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now if Christ be preached that He rose from the dead,
how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the
dead? But <hi rend='italic'>if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ
not risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain,
and your faith is also vain</hi>. Yea, and we are found false witnesses
of God; because we have testified of God that <hi rend='italic'>He raised
up Christ</hi>: whom He raised not up, if so be that the dead rise
not. For <hi rend='italic'>if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if
Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins</hi>.
Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are <hi rend='italic'>perished</hi>.
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most
miserable.</q> 1 Cor. 15:12-19.
</p>

<p>
9. What positive declaration does the apostle then make?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>But now is Christ risen
from the dead</hi>, and become the first-fruits
of them that slept. For since by man came death, by
man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all
die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</q> Verses 20-22.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
resurrection of Christ is in many respects the most
significant fact in history. It is the great and impregnable foundation
and hope of the Christian church. Every fundamental truth of Christianity
is involved in the resurrection of Christ. If this could be overthrown,
every essential doctrine of Christianity would be invalidated.
The resurrection of Christ is the pledge of our resurrection and future life.
</quote>

<p>
10. What does Christ proclaim Himself to be?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>I am the resurrection and the life</hi>: he that believeth in Me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
believeth in Me shall never die.</q> John 11:25, 26. <q><hi rend='italic'>I am He
that liveth, and was dead</hi>; and, behold,
<hi rend='italic'>I am alive forevermore</hi>,
Amen; <hi rend='italic'>and have the keys of hell and of death</hi>.</q> Rev. 1:18.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Christ changed death
into a <hi rend='italic'>sleep</hi>. Absolute death knows
no waking; but through Christ all who have fallen under the power of
death will be raised, some to a life unending, some to everlasting death.

11. What question does Job ask and answer?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>If a man die, shall he live again?</hi> all the days of my appointed
time will I wait, till my change come. <hi rend='italic'>Thou shalt call, and I
will answer Thee</hi>: Thou wilt have a desire to the work of Thine
hands.</q> Job 14:14, 15.

<p>
12. Why did Job wish that his words were written in a book,
graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>For I know that My Redeemer liveth</hi>, and that He shall
stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin
worms destroy this body, yet <hi rend='italic'>in my flesh shall I see God</hi>.</q> Job
19:25, 26.
</p>

<p>
13. How does Paul say the saints will be raised?
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but
we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and <hi rend='italic'>the dead shall
be raised incorruptible</hi>.</q> 1 Cor. 15:51, 52.
</p>

<p>
14. What great change will then take place in their bodies?
</p>

<p>
<q>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It
is <hi rend='italic'>sown in corruption</hi>;
it is <hi rend='italic'>raised in incorruption</hi>:
it is <hi rend='italic'>sown in dishonor; it is raised
in glory</hi>: it is <hi rend='italic'>sown in weakness</hi>;
it is <hi rend='italic'>raised in power</hi>: it is <hi rend='italic'>sown a
natural body</hi>; it is <hi rend='italic'>raised a spiritual body</hi>.</q> Verses 42-44.
</p>

<p>
15. What saying will then be brought to pass?
</p>

<p>
<q>O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</q>
Verse 55.
</p>

<p>
16. When did David say he would be satisfied?
</p>

<p>
<q>As for me, I will behold Thy face in righteousness: I shall
be satisfied, <hi rend='italic'>when I awake, with Thy likeness</hi>.</q> Ps. 17:15.
</p>

<p>
17. What comforting promise has God made concerning the
sleeping saints?
</p>

<p>
<q>I will <hi rend='italic'>ransom them from
the power of the grave</hi>; I will <hi rend='italic'>redeem
them from death</hi>: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will
be thy destruction.</q> Hosea 13:14.
</p>

<p>
18. What else has He promised to do?
</p>

<p>
<q>And God <hi rend='italic'>shall wipe away all tears</hi> from their eyes; and there
shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall
there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.</q>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
The millennium is the closing period of God's great
week of time&mdash;a great sabbath of rest to the earth and to the people
of God.
</p>

<p>
It follows the close of the gospel age, and precedes
the setting up of the everlasting kingdom of God on earth.
</p>

<p>
It comprehends what in the Scriptures is
frequently spoken of as <q>the day of the Lord.</q>
</p>

<p>
It is bounded at each end by a resurrection.
</p>

<p>
Its beginning is marked by the pouring out
of the seven last plagues, the second coming of Christ, the resurrection of
the righteous dead, the binding of Satan, and
the translation of the saints to heaven; and its close, by the descent of the New
Jerusalem, with Christ and the saints, from
heaven, the resurrection of the wicked dead, the loosing of Satan, and the final
destruction of the wicked.
</p>

<p>
During the one thousand years the earth
lies desolate; Satan and his angels are confined here; and the saints, with Christ,
sit in judgment on the wicked, preparatory to their final punishment.
</p>

<p>
The wicked dead are then raised; Satan is loosed
for a little season, and he and the host of the wicked encompass the
camp of the saints and the holy city, when fire
comes down from God out of heaven and devours them. The earth is cleansed
by the same fire that destroys the wicked, and,
renewed, becomes the eternal abode of the saints.
</p>

<p>
The millennium is one of <q>the ages to come.</q>
Its close will mark the beginning of the new earth state.

4. How many resurrections are there to be?
</p>

<p>
<q>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which
all that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come
forth; they that have done good, unto <hi rend='italic'>the resurrection of life</hi>;
and they that have done evil, unto <hi rend='italic'>the resurrection
of damnation</hi>.</q>
John 5:28, 29.
</p>

<p>
5. What class only have part in the first resurrection?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Blessed and holy</hi> is he that hath part in the first resurrection:
on such the second death hath no power.</q> Rev. 20:6.
</p>

<p>
6. What will Christ do with the saints when He comes?
</p>

<p>
<q>I will come again, and <hi rend='italic'>receive you unto Myself</hi>; that where
I am, there ye may be also.</q> John 14:3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In other words, Christ
will take them to heaven, there to
live and reign with Him during the one thousand years.
</quote>

<p>
7. Where did John, in vision, see the saints?
</p>

<p>
<q>After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no
man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and
tongues, <hi rend='italic'>stood before the throne, and before the Lamb</hi>, clothed
with white robes, and palms in their hands.</q> Rev. 7:9.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This scripture
shows plainly that the righteous are all taken
to heaven immediately after the first resurrection. This accords with
the words of Christ in John 14:1-3, where He says, <q>I go to prepare a
place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again,
and <emph>receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also</emph>.</q> Peter
desired to accompany Christ to those mansions; but Jesus answered, <q>Thou
canst not follow Me now; <emph>but thou shall follow Me afterwards</emph>.</q> John 13:36.
This makes it clear that when Christ returns to earth to receive His
people, He takes them to the Father's house in heaven.
</quote>

<p>
8. What becomes of the living wicked when Christ comes?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>As it was in the days of Noe</hi>, so shall it be also in the days
of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married
wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered
into the ark, and <hi rend='italic'>the flood came, and destroyed them all.
Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot</hi>; ... the same day
that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
heaven, and <hi rend='italic'>destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day
when the Son of man is revealed</hi>.</q> Luke 17:26-30.
</p>

<p>
9. What does the apostle Paul say concerning this?
</p>

<p>
<q>When they shall say, Peace and safety; <hi rend='italic'>then sudden
destruction cometh upon them</hi>, ... and they shall not
escape.</q> 1 Thess. 5:3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;When Christ
comes, the righteous will be delivered and taken
to heaven, and all the living wicked will be suddenly destroyed, as they
were at the time of the flood. For further proof see 2 Thess. 1:7-9; Rev.
6:14-17; 19:11-21; Jer. 25:30-33. There will be no general resurrection
of the wicked until the end of the one thousand years. This will leave the
earth desolate and without human inhabitant during this period.

10. What description does the prophet Jeremiah give of
the earth during this time?
</p>

<p>
<q>I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was <hi rend='italic'>without form, and void</hi>;
and the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains,
and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.
I beheld, and, lo, <hi rend='italic'>there was no man</hi>, and all the birds of the
heavens were fled. I beheld, and, lo, the <hi rend='italic'>fruitful place was a
wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down</hi> at the
presence of the Lord, and by His fierce anger.</q> Jer. 4:23-26.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;At the
coming of Christ the earth is reduced to a chaotic
state&mdash;to a mass of ruins. The heavens depart as a scroll when it is
rolled together; mountains are moved out of their places; and the earth
is left a dark, dreary, desolate waste. See Isa. 24:1-3; Rev. 6:14-17.
</quote>

<p>
11. How does Isaiah speak of the wicked at this time?
</p>

<p>
<q>It shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall punish
the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the
earth upon the earth. And they shall be gathered together,
as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and <hi rend='italic'>shall be shut up in
prison</hi>, and after many days shall they be visited.</q> Isa. 24:21, 22.
</p>

<p>
12. How long is Satan to be imprisoned on this earth?
</p>

<p>
<q>I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key
of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he
laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil,
and Satan, and <hi rend='italic'>bound him a thousand years</hi>, and cast him into
the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him,
that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand
years should be fulfilled.</q> Rev. 20:1-3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The word
rendered <q>bottomless pit</q> in this text is
<foreign lang='el' rend='italic'>abusos</foreign>,
the Greek term employed by the Septuagint in Gen. 1:2, as the equivalent
of the Hebrew word rendered <q>deep</q> in our English versions. A more
literal translation would be <q>abyss.</q> It is a term applied to the earth
in its desolate, waste, chaotic, dark, uninhabited condition. In this condition
it will remain during the one thousand years. It will be the dreary
prison-house of Satan during this period. Here, in the midst of the moldering
bones of wicked dead, slain at Christ's second coming, the broken-down
cities, and the wreck and ruin of all the pomp and power of this
world, Satan will have opportunity to reflect upon the results of his rebellion
against God. But the prophecy of Isaiah says, <q>After many days
shall they be visited.</q>
</quote>

<p>
13. The righteous dead are raised at Christ's second coming.
When will the rest of the dead, the wicked, be raised?
</p>

<p>
<q>The rest of the dead lived not again <hi rend='italic'>until the thousand years
were finished</hi>.</q> Verse 5.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;From this we see
that the beginning and the close of the millennium,
or one thousand years, are marked by the two resurrections.
<pb n='359'/><anchor id='Pg359'/>
The word millennium is from two Latin words,
<foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>mille</foreign>, meaning a
thousand, and <foreign lang='la' rend='italic'>annus</foreign>,
year&mdash;a thousand years. It covers the time during
which Satan is to be bound and wicked men and angels are to be judged.
This period is bounded by distinct events. Its beginning is marked by the
close of probation, the pouring out of the seven last plagues, the second
coming of Christ, and the resurrection of the righteous dead. It closes
with the resurrection of the wicked, and their final destruction in the lake
of fire. See diagram on page <ref target='Pg356'>356</ref>.
</quote>

<p>
14. What change is made in Satan's condition at the close
of the one thousand years?
</p>

<p>
<q>After that <hi rend='italic'>he must be loosed a little season</hi>.</q> Verse 3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;At the close
of the one thousand years, Christ, accompanied
by the saints, comes to the earth again, to execute judgment upon the
wicked, and to prepare the earth, by a re-creation, for the eternal abode of
the righteous. At this time, in answer to the summons of Christ, the
wicked dead of all ages awake to life. This is the second resurrection, the
resurrection unto damnation. The wicked come forth with the same
rebellious spirit which possessed them in this life. Then Satan is loosed
from his long period of captivity and inactivity.
</quote>

<p>
15. As soon as the wicked are raised, what does Satan at
once proceed to do?
</p>

<p>
<q>When the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed
out of his prison, and shall go out to <hi rend='italic'>deceive the nations</hi> which
are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, <hi rend='italic'>to gather
them together to battle</hi>: the number of whom is as the sand of the
sea.</q> Verses 7, 8.
</p>

<p>
16. Against whom do the wicked go to make war, and what
is the outcome?
</p>

<p>
<q>They went up on the breadth of the earth, and <hi rend='italic'>compassed
the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city</hi>; and <hi rend='italic'>fire came
down from God out of heaven, and devoured them</hi>.</q> Verse 9.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;This is the
last act in the great controversy between Christ
and Satan. The whole human race meet here for the first and last time.
The eternal separation of the righteous from the wicked here takes place.
At this time the judgment of God is executed upon the wicked in the lake
of fire. This is the second death. This ends the great rebellion against
God and His government. Now is heard the voice of God as He sits upon
His throne, speaking to the saints, and saying, <q>Behold, I make all things
new;</q> and out of the burning ruins of the old earth there springs forth before
the admiring gaze of the millions of the redeemed, <q>a new heaven and a
new earth,</q> in which they shall find an everlasting inheritance and dwelling-place.
</p>

<p>
The millennium is a great sabbath of rest, both for the earth and for
God's people. For six thousand years the earth and its inhabitants have
been groaning under the curse of sin. The millennium, the seventh
thousand, will be a sabbath of rest and release; for, says the prophet concerning
the land, <q>as long as she lay desolate she kept <emph>sabbath</emph>.</q> 2 Chron.
36:21. <q>There remaineth therefore a <emph>rest</emph> [margin, <emph>keeping of a
sabbath</emph>] to the people of God.</q> Heb. 4:9. This precedes the new earth state.

<q>Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the

<p>
<q>And His disciples asked Him, saying, Why then say the

<q>Many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord

7. Near the close of the three and one-half years' drought

of Elijah (James 5:17) in consequence of Israel's apostasy,
what accusation did King Ahab bring against Elijah?
</p>

8. What answer did Elijah make?

<q>And he answered, <hi rend='italic'>I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and
thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of
the Lord, and thou hast followed Baalim</hi>.</q> Verse 18.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Israel had
departed from God, forsaken His commandments,
and gone off into idolatry. Jezebel, Ahab's wicked and idolatrous wife,
had <q>cut off the prophets of the Lord</q> (verse 4), was supporting hundreds
of the prophets of Baal, and was seeking Elijah to slay him. Elijah called
for a famine on the land, and said to Ahab, <q>As the Lord God of Israel
liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years,

if Baal, then follow him</hi>.</q> 1 Kings 18:21.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The result
of the test by fire which followed on Mt. Carmel,

10. What was the burden of the message of John the Baptist?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Repent ye</hi>: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</q> <q>Bring

</p>

<pb n='365'/><anchor id='Pg365'/>

<p>
11. What was the result of this message?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all
the region round about Jordan, and <hi rend='italic'>were baptized of him in
Jordan, confessing their sins</hi>.</q> Verses 5, 6.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;There
was a genuine work of repentance and reform. John
was not satisfied with a mere profession of religion. He told the Pharisees
and Sadducees who came to his baptism, to <q>bring forth fruits</q> answerable
to an <q>amendment of life.</q> He wished to see religion in the life, the
heart, the home. Thus he prepared a people for Christ's first advent.

<p>
12. But when, according to the prophecy, was Elijah to
be sent?
</p>

<p>
<q>Before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the
Lord.</q> Mal. 4:5.
</p>

<p>
13. How is this great and dreadful day described in this
same prophecy?
</p>

<p>
<q>For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven;
and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble:
and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of
hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.</q> Verse 1.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This day
is yet future. It cannot be, therefore, that the
work done by John the Baptist at Christ's first advent is all that was contemplated
in the prophecy concerning the sending of Elijah the prophet.
It must be that there is to be another and greater fulfilment of it, to precede
Christ's <emph>second advent</emph>, and to prepare, or <q>make ready,</q> a people
for that great event.

<p>
14. What is the burden of the threefold message of Rev.
14:6-10?
</p>

<p>
<q>Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment
is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth,
and the sea, and the fountains of waters.... Babylon is
fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations
drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.... If
any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark
in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine
of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into
the cup of His indignation.</q> Rev. 14:6-10.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Like the messages
of Elijah and John, this is a call to repentance
and reform,&mdash;a call to forsake false, idolatrous worship, and to
turn to God, and worship Him, and Him alone. The first part of this
threefold message points out the true God, the Creator, in language very
similar to that found in the fourth, or Sabbath, commandment. This is
the message now due the world, and that is now being proclaimed to the
world. See readings on pages <ref target='Pg251'>251-263</ref>. Those who are proclaiming
these messages constitute the Elijah for this time, as John and his colaborers
did at the time of Christ's first advent.
</quote>

<pb n='366'/><anchor id='Pg366'/>

<p>
15. How are the people described who are developed by the
threefold message here referred to?
</p>

<p>
<q>Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep
the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</q> Verse 12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;These will
be the ones who will be ready to meet Jesus when
He comes. They have heeded the Elijah-call to repentance and reform.
They have become concerned, not only for their own individual salvation,
but for the salvation of their friends and relatives. By this message the
hearts of the fathers are turned to the children, and the hearts of the
children to their fathers. Each becomes burdened for the conversion and
salvation of the other. There can be little religion in the heart of one who
cares not for the eternal interests of his loved ones. When this message
has done its work, God will smite the earth with a curse; the seven last
plagues will fall, and usher in the great day of the Lord described in the
preceding reading.

<p>
I
</p>

<p>
Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.
</p>

<p>
II
</p>

<p>
Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness
of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not
bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy
God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon
the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that
hate Me; and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love
Me, and keep My commandments.
</p>

<p>
III
</p>

<p>
Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain;
for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name
in vain.
</p>

<p>
IV
</p>

<p>
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt
thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath
of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou,
nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man servant, nor thy maid
servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:
for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord
blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.
</p>

<p>
V
</p>

<p>
Honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long
upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
</p>

<p>
VI
</p>

<p>
Thou shalt not kill.
</p>

<p>
VII
</p>

<p>
Thou shalt not commit adultery.
</p>

<p>
VIII
</p>

IX
</p>

Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

X
</p>

Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not
covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man servant, nor his maid
servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy
neighbor's.

"The law of the Lord is perfect, converting
the soul." Ps. 19:7.</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
1. When God brought His people out of Egypt, how did He
republish His law?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire:
ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye
heard a voice. And <hi rend='italic'>He declared unto you His covenant, which
He commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and He
wrote them upon two tables of stone</hi>.</q> Deut. 4:12, 13. See also
Neh. 9:13, 14.
</p>

<p>
2. Where are the ten commandments recorded?
</p>

<p>
In Ex. 20:2-17.
</p>

<p>
3. How comprehensive are these commandments?
</p>

<p>
<q>Fear God, and keep His commandments: for <hi rend='italic'>this is the
whole duty of man</hi>.</q> Eccl. 12:13.
</p>

<p>
4. What inspired tribute is paid to the law of God?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>The law of the Lord is perfect</hi>, converting the soul: the
testimony of the Lord is <hi rend='italic'>sure</hi>, making wise the simple. The statutes
of the Lord are <hi rend='italic'>right</hi>, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of
the Lord is <hi rend='italic'>pure</hi>, enlightening the eyes.</q> Ps. 19:7, 8.
</p>

<p>
5. What blessing does the psalmist say attends the keeping
of God's commandments?
</p>

<p>
<q>Moreover by them is Thy servant warned: and <hi rend='italic'>in keeping
of them there is great reward</hi>.</q> Verse 11.
</p>

<p>
6. What did Christ state as a condition of entering into life?
</p>

<p>
<q>If thou wilt enter into life, <hi rend='italic'>keep the commandments</hi>.</q> Matt.
19:17.
</p>

<pb n='370'/><anchor id='Pg370'/>

<p>
7. Can man of himself, unaided by Christ, keep the law?
</p>

<p>
<q>I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in Me,
and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for <hi rend='italic'>without
Me ye can do nothing</hi>.</q> John 15:5. See also Rom. 7:14-19.
</p>

<p>
8. What provision has been made so that we may keep God's
law?
</p>

<p>
<q>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through
the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful
flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness
of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the
flesh, but after the Spirit.</q> Rom. 8:3, 4.
</p>

<p>
9. What is the nature of God's law?
</p>

<p>
<q>For we know that <hi rend='italic'>the law is spiritual</hi>: but I am carnal,
sold under sin.</q> Rom. 7:14.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In His
comments on the sixth and seventh commandments,
recorded in Matt. 5:21-28, Christ demonstrated the spiritual nature of the
law, showing that it relates not merely to outward actions, but that it
reaches to the thoughts and intents of the heart. See also Heb. 4:12. The
tenth commandment forbids lust, or all unlawful desire. Rom. 7:7.
Obedience to this law, therefore, requires not merely an outward compliance,
but genuine heart service. This can be rendered only by a regenerated
soul.
</quote>

<p>
10. How is the law further described?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore the law is <hi rend='italic'>holy</hi>,
and the commandment <hi rend='italic'>holy</hi>,
and <hi rend='italic'>just</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>good</hi>.</q> Verse 12.
</p>

<p>
11. What is revealed in God's law?.
</p>

<p>
<q>And knowest <hi rend='italic'>His</hi>
[<hi rend='italic'>God's</hi>] <hi rend='italic'>will</hi>, and approvest the things
that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law.</q> Rom.
2:18.
</p>

<p>
12. When Christ came to this earth, what was His attitude
toward God's will, or law?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is
written of Me, <hi rend='italic'>I delight to do Thy will, O My God: yea, Thy law
is within My heart</hi>.</q> Ps. 40:7, 8. See Heb. 10:5, 7.
</p>

<p>
13. Who did He say would enter the kingdom of heaven?
</p>

<p>
<q>Not every one that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter
into the kingdom of heaven; but <hi rend='italic'>he that doeth the will of My
Father which is in heaven</hi>.</q> Matt. 7:21.
</p>

<p>
14. What did He say of those who should break one of God's
commandments, or should teach men to do so?
</p>

<pb n='371'/><anchor id='Pg371'/>

<p>
<q>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,
and shall teach men so, <hi rend='italic'>he shall be called the least
in the kingdom of heaven</hi>.</q> Matt. 5:19, first part.
</p>

<p>
15. Who did He say would be called great in the kingdom?
</p>

<p>
<q>But <hi rend='italic'>whosoever shall do and teach them</hi>, the same shall be
called great in the kingdom.</q> Same verse, last part.
</p>

<p>
16. How did Christ estimate the righteousness of the scribes
and Pharisees?
</p>

<p>
<q>For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall
exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, <hi rend='italic'>ye shall
in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven</hi>.</q> Verse 20.
</p>

<p>
17. For what did Christ reprove the Pharisees?
</p>

<p>
<q>But He answered and said unto them, <hi rend='italic'>Why do ye also
transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</hi></q> Matt.
15:3.
</p>

<p>
18. How had they done this?
</p>

<p>
<q>For God commanded, saying, Honor thy father and mother....
But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his
mother, It is a gift, ... and honor not his father or his
mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment
of God of none effect by your tradition.</q> Verses 4-6.
</p>

<p>
19. In consequence of this, what value did Christ place upon
their worship?
</p>

<p>
<q>But <hi rend='italic'>in vain they do worship Me</hi>, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men.</q> Verse 9.
</p>

<p>
20. What is sin declared to be?
</p>

<p>
<q>Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for
<hi rend='italic'>sin is the transgression of the law</hi>.</q> 1 John 3:4.
</p>

<p>
21. By what is the knowledge of sin?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>by the law is the knowledge of sin</hi>.</q> Rom. 3:20. See
Rom. 7:7.
</p>

<p>
22. How many of the commandments is it necessary to
break in order to become a transgressor of the law?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
point, he is guilty of all</hi>. For He that said, Do not commit
adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery,
and yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the
law.</q> James 2:10, 11.
</p>

<pb n='372'/><anchor id='Pg372'/>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This shows that the ten commandments are a complete
whole, and together constitute but one law. Like a chain of ten links,
all are inseparably connected together. If one link is broken, the chain
is broken.
</quote>

<p>
23. How may we be freed from the guilt of our sins, or our
transgressions of God's law?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>If we confess our sins</hi>, He is faithful and just to forgive us
our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</q> 1 John
1:9.
</p>

<p>
24. Why are we admonished to fear God and keep His
commandments?
</p>

<p>
<q>Fear God, and keep His commandments: for this is the
whole duty of man. <hi rend='italic'>For God shall bring every work into judgment</hi>,
with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be
evil.</q> Eccl. 12:13, 14.
</p>

<p>
25. What will be the standard in the judgment?
</p>

<p>
<q>So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be <hi rend='italic'>judged by the
law of liberty</hi>.</q> James 2:12.
</p>

<p>
26. What is said of those who love God's law?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Great peace have they which love Thy law</hi>: and nothing shall
offend them.</q> Ps. 119:165.
</p>

<p>
27. What would obedience to God's commandments have
insured to ancient Israel?
</p>

<p>
<q>O that thou hadst harkened to My commandments! <hi rend='italic'>then
had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of
the sea</hi>.</q> Isa. 48:18.
</p>

<p>
28. What is another blessing attending the keeping of God's
commandments?
</p>

<p>
<q>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a <hi rend='italic'>good
understanding have all they that do His commandments</hi>.</q> Ps.
111:10.
</p>

<p>
29. In what does the man delight whom the psalmist describes
as blessed?
</p>

<p>
<q>Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the
ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the
seat of the scornful. But <hi rend='italic'>his delight is in the law of the Lord;
and in His law doth he meditate day and night</hi>.</q> Ps. 1:1, 2.
See Rom. 7:22.
</p>

<p>
30. Why is the carnal mind enmity against God?
</p>

<pb n='373'/><anchor id='Pg373'/>

<p>
<q>Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: <hi rend='italic'>for it is
not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be</hi>.</q> Rom. 8:7.
</p>

<p>
31. How do those with renewed hearts and minds regard
the commandments of God?
</p>

<p>
<q>For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments:
and <hi rend='italic'>His commandments are not grievous</hi>.</q> 1 John 5:3.
</p>

<p>
32. What is the essential principle of the law of God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Love worketh no ill to his neighbor: therefore <hi rend='italic'>love</hi> is the
fulfilling of the law.</q> Rom. 13:10.
</p>

<p>
33. In what two great commandments is the law of God
briefly summarized?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and
great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments
hang all the law and the prophets.</q> Matt. 22:37-40.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;<q>Does
any man say to me, <q>You see, then, instead of the
ten commandments, we have received the two commandments, and these
are much easier</q>? I answer that this reading of the law is not in the least
easier. Such a remark implies a want of thought and experience. Those
two precepts comprehend the ten at their fullest extent, and cannot be
regarded as the erasure of a jot or tittle of them. Whatever difficulties
surround the commands are equally found in the two, which are their sum
and substance. If you love God with all your heart, you must keep the
first table; and if you love your neighbor as yourself, you must keep the
second table.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>The Perpetuity

</p>

<p>
<q>The laws of the Jews are commonly divided into moral, ceremonial,
and judicial. The moral laws are such as grow out of the nature of things,
which cannot, therefore, be changed,&mdash;such as the duty of loving God and
His creatures. These cannot be abolished, as it can never be made right
to hate God, or to hate our fellow men. Of this kind are the ten commandments;
<pb n='375'/><anchor id='Pg375'/>
and these our Saviour neither abolished nor superseded. The ceremonial
laws are such as are appointed to meet certain states of society,

untouched.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Dr. Albert Barnes, on Matt. 5:18.</hi>

and that very fact shows that it remains; for there is no need to explain
that which is abrogated.... By thus explaining the law He confirmed
it; He could not have meant to abolish it, or He would not have
needed to expound it.... That the Master did not come to alter
the law is clear, because after having embodied it in His life, He willingly
gave Himself up to bear its penalty, though He had never broken it, bearing
the penalty for us, even as it is written, <q>Christ hath redeemed us from
the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.</q> ... If the law had
demanded more of us than it ought to have done, would the Lord Jesus
have rendered to it the penalty which resulted from its too severe demands?
I am sure He would not. But because the law asked only what it ought
to ask, namely, perfect obedience, and exacted of the transgressor only
what it ought to exact, namely, death as the penalty for sin,&mdash;death under
divine wrath,&mdash;therefore the Saviour went to the tree, and there bore our
sins, and purged them once for all.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>The

<p>
<q>The moral law contained in the ten commandments, and enforced
by the prophets, He did not take away. It was not the design of His coming
to revoke any part of this.... Every part of this law must remain
in force upon all mankind and in all ages, as not depending either on time
or place, or any other circumstance liable to change, but on the nature of
God, and the nature of man, and their unchangeable relation to each

the world must perish. The law could not give way. Says Spurgeon
in his sermon on <q>The Perpetuity of the Law of God,</q> <q>Our Lord Jesus
Christ gave a greater vindication of the law by dying because it had been
broken than all the lost can ever give by their miseries.</q> The fact that

<p>
1. How does Nehemiah describe the giving of the law at
Sinai?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou earnest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest
with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and
true laws, good statutes and commandments: and madest known
unto them Thy holy Sabbath, and commandedst them precepts,
statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses Thy servant.</q> Neh.
9:13, 14.
</p>

<p>
2. What is declared to be the chief advantage possessed
by the Jews?
</p>

<p>
<q>What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there
of circumcision? Much every way: <hi rend='italic'>chiefly, because that unto
them were committed the oracles of God</hi>.</q> Rom. 3:1, 2.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The law was
not spoken at this time exclusively for the
benefit of the Hebrews. God honored them by making them the guardians
and keepers of His law, but He intended that it should be held by them as
a sacred trust for the whole world. The precepts of the decalogue are
adapted to all mankind, and they were given for the instruction and government
of all. <q>Ten precepts, brief, comprehensive, and authoritative, cover
the duty of man to God and to his fellow men;</q> and all are based upon the
great fundamental principle of love. <q>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with
all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.</q> Luke 10:27. In the ten
commandments these principles are carried out in detail, and are made
applicable to the condition and circumstances of man.

3. Before the giving of the law at Sinai, what did Moses say
when Jethro asked him concerning his judging the people?
</p>

<p>
<q>When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge
between one and another, and <hi rend='italic'>I do make them know the statutes
of God, and His laws</hi>.</q> Ex. 18:16.
</p>

<p>
4. What explanation did Moses give the rulers of Israel
concerning the withholding of the manna on the seventh day
in the wilderness of Sin, before they reached Sinai?
</p>

<p>
<q>And he said unto them, This is that which the Lord hath
said, <hi rend='italic'>Tomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord</hi>....
Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day,
<hi rend='italic'>which is the Sabbath</hi>, in it there shall be none.</q> Ex. 16:23-26.

5. When some went out to gather manna on the seventh day,
what did the Lord say to Moses?

</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore then serveth the law?</q> Gal. 3:19.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

use or service was the law announced at
Sinai? What special purpose had God in view in giving it then?
</quote>

<p>
7. What answer is given to this question?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>It was added, because of transgressions</hi>, till the seed should
come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by
angels in the hand of a mediator.</q> Same verse.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;The Greek
word here translated <q>added</q> is the same one
that is translated <q>spoken</q> in Heb. 12:19.
</p>

<p>
<q>The meaning is that <emph>the law was given to show the true
nature of transgressions</emph>,
or <emph>to show what sin is</emph>. It was not to reveal a way of justification,
but it was <emph>to disclose the true nature of sin</emph>; to deter men from committing
it; to declare its penalty; <emph>to convince men of it</emph>, and thus to be ancillary
to, and preparatory to, the work of redemption through the Redeemer. This
is the true account of the law of God as given to apostate man, and this
use of the law still exists.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Dr. Albert Barnes, on
Gal. 3:19.</hi>
</p>
</quote>

<p>
8. How is this same truth again expressed?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy,
and just, and good. Was then that which is good made death
unto me? God forbid. <hi rend='italic'>But sin, that it might appear sin, working
death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment
might become exceeding sinful.</hi></q> Rom. 7:12, 13.

<p>
9. For what purpose did the law enter?
</p>

<p>
<q>Moreover the law entered, <hi rend='italic'>that the offense might abound</hi>.</q>
Rom. 5:20.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;By the giving
of the law at Sinai, then, God designed, not
to increase or multiply sin, but that men might, through a new revelation
of Him and of His character and will, as expressed in a <emph>plainly spoken</emph> and
<emph>plainly written</emph> law, the better see <emph>the awful sinfulness of
sin</emph>, and thus <emph>their utter helplessness</emph> and <emph>undone
condition</emph>. While in Egypt, surrounded as
they were with idolatry and sin, and as the result of their long bondage
and hard servitude, Israel even, the special people of God, had largely forgotten
God and lost sight of His requirements. Until one realizes that he
is a sinner, he cannot see his need of a Saviour from sin. Hence the entering,
or republication, of the law to the world through Israel at Sinai.

<quote rend='display'>

words, the lawful use of the written law is to show

shut men up under sin, and thus lead them to Christ.

</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;<q>What
is the law of God for? for us to keep in order to
be saved by it?&mdash;Not at all. It is sent in order to show us that we cannot
be saved by works, and to shut us up to be saved by grace. But if you
make out that the law is altered so that a man can keep it, you have left
him his old legal hope, and he is sure to cling to it. You need a perfect
law that shuts man right up to hopelessness apart from Jesus, puts him
into an iron cage, and locks him up, and offers him no escape but by faith
in Jesus; then he begins to cry, <q>Lord, save me by grace, for I perceive that
I cannot be saved by my own works.</q> This is how Paul describes it to the
Galatians: <q>The Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise
by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. But before
faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which
should afterwards be revealed. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster
to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</q>  I say you
have deprived the gospel of its ablest auxiliary when you set aside the law.
You have taken away from it the schoolmaster that is to bring men to
Christ. They will never accept grace till they tremble before a just and
holy law. Therefore the law serves a most necessary and blessed purpose,
and it must not be removed from its place.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>The
Perpetuity of the Law
of God,</q> by C. H. Spurgeon, pages 10, 11.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<q>And let it be observed that the law did not answer this end merely
among the Jews, in the days of the apostles: it is just as necessary to the
Gentiles, to the present hour. Nor do we find that true repentance takes
place where the moral law is not preached and enforced. Those who
preach only the gospel to sinners, at best only heal the hurt of the daughter
of My people slightly.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Dr. Adam Clarke,
on Rom. 7:13 (edition 1860).</hi>
</p>

<p>
Commenting on Gal. 3:23, Mr. Spurgeon, in his <q>Sermon Notes,</q>
CCXII, says: <q>Here we have a condensed history of the world before the
gospel was fully revealed by the coming of our Lord Jesus.... The
history of each saved soul is a miniature likeness of the story of the ages.</q>
That is, in his experience, each individual that is saved is first in darkness;
he then comes to Sinai and learns that he is a sinner; this leads him to
Calvary for the pardon of his sins, and so to full and final salvation.

<p>
7. What is the result of wilful sin?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>if we sin wilfully</hi> after that we have received the
knowledge of the truth, <hi rend='italic'>there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins</hi>,
but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation,
which shall devour the adversaries.</q> Heb. 10:26, 27.
</p>

<p>
8. Under the theocracy, how were the rebellious or wilful
transgressors treated?
</p>

<p>
<q>He that despised Moses' law <hi rend='italic'>died without mercy</hi> under two
or three witnesses.</q> Verse 28.
</p>

<p>
9. What awaits those who despise the means of grace?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Of how much sorer punishment</hi>,
suppose ye, <hi rend='italic'>shall he be
thought worthy, who hath trodden underfoot the Son of God</hi>, and
hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was
sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the
Spirit of grace?</q> Verse 29.
</p>

<p>
10. Is it the duty of gospel ministers to execute vengeance?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now then <hi rend='italic'>we are ambassadors for Christ</hi>, as though God did
beseech you by us.</q> 2 Cor. 5:20. See 2 Tim. 2:24-26.
</p>

<p>
11. To whom does vengeance belong?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Vengeance is Mine; I will repay</hi>, saith the Lord.</q> Rom.
12:19.
</p>

<p>
12. To whom has execution of judgment been committed?
</p>

<p>
<q>For as the Father hath life in Himself; so hath He given
to the Son to have life in Himself; and <hi rend='italic'>hath given Him authority
to execute judgment also</hi>.</q> John 5:26, 27. See Jude 14, 15.
</p>

<p>
13. Because evil is not punished immediately, what presumptuous
course do many pursue?
</p>

<p>
<q>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
speedily, <hi rend='italic'>therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them
to do evil</hi>.</q> Eccl. 8:11.
</p>

<p>
14. What message has God commissioned His ministers to
bear to men?
</p>

<p>
<q>Say ye to the righteous, that <hi rend='italic'>it shall be well with him</hi>: for
they shall eat of the fruit of their doings. <hi rend='italic'>Woe unto the wicked!
it shall be ill with him</hi>: for the reward of his hands shall be given
him.</q> Isa. 3:10, 11.

<p>
1. Can there be sin where there is no law?
</p>

<p>
<q>Because the law worketh wrath: <hi rend='italic'>for where no law is, there
is no transgression</hi>.</q> <q><hi rend='italic'>Sin is
not imputed when there is no law.</hi></q>
Rom. 4:15; 5:13.
</p>

<p>
2. Through what is the knowledge of sin obtained?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>by the law</hi> is the knowledge of sin.</q> <q>I had not
known sin, but <hi rend='italic'>by the law</hi>.</q> Rom. 3:20; 7:7.
</p>

<p>
3. What statement shows that sin was in the world before
the law was given on Mt. Sinai?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>For until the law sin was in the world</hi>: but sin is not imputed
when there is no law.</q> Rom. 5:13.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The fact that sin
was imputed before the law was given at
Sinai is conclusive proof that the law existed before that event.
</quote>

<p>
4. When did sin and death enter the world?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore, as <hi rend='italic'>by one man [Adam] sin entered into the world</hi>,
and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all
have sinned.</q> Verse 12.
</p>

<p>
5. With what words did God admonish Cain?
</p>

<p>
<q>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou
doest not well, <hi rend='italic'>sin lieth at the door</hi>.</q> Gen. 4:7.
</p>

<pb n='387'/><anchor id='Pg387'/>

<p>
6. What shows that God imputed sin to Cain?
</p>

<p>
<q>And He said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy
brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground. And <hi rend='italic'>now art
thou cursed from the earth</hi>, which hath opened her mouth to receive
thy brother's blood from thy hand.</q> Verses 10, 11.
</p>

<p>
7. What was the difference between Cain's and Abel's characters?
</p>

<p>
<q>Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his
brother. And wherefore slew he him? <hi rend='italic'>Because his own works
were evil, and his brother's righteous.</hi></q> 1 John 3:12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;There must, therefore,
have been a standard at that time
by which the characters of men were weighed. That standard must have
defined the difference between right and wrong, and pointed out man's
duty. But this is the province of the law of God. Hence the law of God
must have existed at that time.

<p>
8. In what condition was the world before the flood?
</p>

<p>
<q>The earth also was <hi rend='italic'>corrupt before God</hi>, and the earth was
<hi rend='italic'>filled with violence</hi>.</q> Gen. 6:11.
</p>

<p>
9. What did God purpose to do with the people of that day?
</p>

<p>
<q>And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come
before Me; for the earth is filled with violence through them;
and, behold, <hi rend='italic'>I will destroy them with the earth</hi>.</q> Verse 13.
</p>

<p>
10. What is Noah called?
</p>

<p>
<q>And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth
person, <hi rend='italic'>a preacher of righteousness</hi>.</q> 2 Peter 2:5.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Noah must
have warned the antediluvians against sin, and
preached repentance and that obedience of faith which brings the life into
harmony with the law of God.

<p>
11. Why did the Lord destroy Sodom?
</p>

<p>
<q>The men of Sodom were <hi rend='italic'>wicked</hi>
and <hi rend='italic'>sinners</hi> before the Lord
<hi rend='italic'>exceedingly</hi>.</q> Gen. 13:13.
</p>

<p>
12. What was the character of their deeds?
</p>

<p>
<q>And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation
of the wicked: (for that righteous man dwelling among
them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day
to day with their <hi rend='italic'>unlawful deeds</hi>).</q> 2 Peter 2:7, 8.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Their deeds
would not have been <emph>unlawful</emph> had there been

</p>

<p>
<q>In the fourth generation they [Israel] shall come hither
again: for <hi rend='italic'>the iniquity of the
Amorites is not yet full</hi>.</q> Gen. 15:16.
</p>

<p>
15. Of what sin were the Amorites specially guilty?
</p>

<p>
<q>And he [Ahab] did very abominably in <hi rend='italic'>following idols,
according to all things as did the Amorites</hi>, whom the Lord cast
out before the children of Israel.</q> 1 Kings 21:26.
</p>

<p>
16. Why did the Lord abhor the Canaanites?
</p>

<p>
<q>Ye shall therefore keep all My statutes, and all My judgments,
and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell
therein, spew you not out. And ye shall not walk in the manners
of the nation, which I cast out before you: <hi rend='italic'>for they committed
all these things</hi>, and therefore I abhorred them.</q> Lev.
20:22, 23.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The statement
that <q>they committed all these things</q>
refers to what had been previously forbidden to the Israelites. Among
these things was idolatrous worship (Lev. 20:1-5), showing that the Gentiles,
as well as the Jews, were amenable to the law of God, and were abhorred
of God for violating it.
</quote>

<p>
17. Why did God make His promise to the seed of Abraham?
</p>

<p>
<q>Because Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge,
My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.</q> Gen. 26:5.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Then God's
commandments and laws existed in the time of
Abraham.
</quote>

<p>
18. Before giving the law at Sinai, what did God say because
some of the people went out to gather manna on the
seventh day?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Lord said unto Moses, <hi rend='italic'>How long refuse ye to keep
My commandments and My laws?</hi></q> Ex. 16:28.
</p>

<p>
19. Had the Lord spoken regarding the Sabbath previous
to this time?
</p>

<p>
<q>This is that which the Lord <hi rend='italic'>hath said</hi>, Tomorrow is the rest
of the holy Sabbath.</q> Verse 23.
</p>

<p>
20. Before coming to Sinai, what had Moses taught Israel?
</p>

<p>
<q>When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge
between one and another, and <hi rend='italic'>I do make them know the statutes
of God, and His laws</hi>.</q> Ex. 18:16.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;All this shows that
the law of God existed from the beginning,
and was known and taught in the world before it was proclaimed at Sinai.

1. By what means did the Jews know God's will?

<p>
<q>Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and
makest thy boast of God, and knowest His will, ... <hi rend='italic'>being
instructed out of the law</hi>.</q> Rom. 2:17, 18.
</p>

<p>
2. What did they have in the law?
</p>

<p>
<q>Which hast <hi rend='italic'>the form of knowledge and of the truth</hi> in the
law.</q> Verse 20.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The written law
presents the <emph>form</emph> of knowledge and of the
truth. Grace and truth, or grace and the reality or realization of that
which the written law demands, came by Jesus Christ. He was the law in
life and action.
</quote>

<p>
3. What did Jesus say of His attitude toward the law?
</p>

<p>
<q>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:
<hi rend='italic'>I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil</hi>.</q> Matt. 5:17.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;By the
expression <q>the law</q> here is meant the five books
of Moses; and by <q>the prophets,</q> the writings of the prophets. Christ
did not come to set aside or to destroy either of these, but to fulfil both.
The ceremonialism of types and shadows contained in the books written
by Moses He fulfilled by meeting them as their great Antitype. The moral
law, the great basic fabric underlying all of Moses' writings, Christ fulfilled
by a life of perfect obedience to all its requirements. The prophets
He fulfilled in His advent as the Messiah, Prophet, Teacher, and Saviour
foretold by them.
</quote>

<pb n='390'/><anchor id='Pg390'/>

<p>
4. What did He teach concerning the stability of the law?
</p>

<p>
<q>For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one
jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</q>
Verse 18.
</p>

<p>
5. In what instruction did He emphasize the importance
of keeping the law?
</p>

<p>
<q>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,
and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least
in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach
them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</q>
Verse 19.
</p>

<p>
6. What did Christ tell the rich young man to do in order
to enter into life?
</p>

<p>
<q>If thou wilt enter into life, <hi rend='italic'>keep the commandments</hi>.</q> Matt.
19:17.
</p>

<p>
7. When asked which commandments, what did Jesus say?
</p>

<p>
<q>Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit
adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false
witness, Honor thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt
love thy neighbor as thyself.</q> Verses 18, 19.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;While not quoting all of the ten commandments, Jesus
quoted sufficient of them to show that He referred to the moral law. In
quoting the second great commandment He called attention to the great
principle underlying the second table of the law,&mdash;love
to one's neighbor,&mdash;which
the rich young man, in his covetousness, was not keeping.
</quote>

<p>
8. Does faith render the law void?
</p>

<p>
<q>Do we then make void the law through faith? <hi rend='italic'>God forbid:
yea, we establish the law.</hi></q> Rom. 3:31.
</p>

<p>
9. How is the law fulfilled?
</p>

<p>
<q>Owe no man anything, but to love one another: for <hi rend='italic'>he that
loveth another hath fulfilled the law</hi>. For this, Thou shalt not
commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal,
Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if
there be any other commandment [touching our duty to our
fellow men], it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely,
Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Love worketh no ill
to his neighbor: therefore <hi rend='italic'>love is the
fulfilling of the law</hi>.</q> Rom.
13:8-10.
</p>

<p>
10. What is of more importance than any outward ceremony?
</p>

<pb n='391'/><anchor id='Pg391'/>

<p>
<q>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing,
but <hi rend='italic'>the keeping of the commandments of God</hi>.</q> 1 Cor. 7:19.
</p>

<p>
11. What kind of mind is not subject to the law of God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Because <hi rend='italic'>the carnal mind</hi> is enmity against God: for it
is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</q>
Rom. 8:7.
</p>

<p>
12. What proves that the law is an undivided whole?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
point, he is guilty of all.</hi> For He that said [margin, <hi rend='italic'>that law
which said</hi>], Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.
Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become
a transgressor of the law. So speak ye, and so do, as they
that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</q> James 2:10-12.
</p>

<p>
13. How is sin defined?
</p>

<p>
<q>Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for

<q>By this we know that we love the children of God, <hi rend='italic'>when
we love God, and keep His commandments</hi>.</q> 1 John 5:2.
</p>

<p>
15. What is the love of God declared to be?
</p>

<q>For <hi rend='italic'>this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments</hi>:
and His commandments are not grievous.</q> Verse 3.

<p>
16. How is the church of the last days described?

<p>
<q>And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to

<head>Love the Fulfilling of the Law</head>

<p>
<q>If the love of God is shed abroad in your heart,</q>
says Mr. Moody, <q>you will be able to fulfil the law.</q>
Paul reduces the commandments to one: <q>Thou
shalt love,</q> and says that <q>love is the fulfilling of the
law.</q> This truth may be demonstrated thus:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l>1. Love to God will admit no other god.</l>
<l>2. Love will not debase the object it adores.</l>
<l>3. Love to God will never dishonor His name.</l>
<l>4. Love to God will reverence His day.</l>
<l>5. Love to parents will honor them.</l>
<l>6. Hate, not love, is a murderer.</l>
<l>7. Lust, not love, commits adultery.</l>
<l>8. Love will give, but never steal.</l>

<p>
1. What title of distinction is given the law of God?
</p>

<p>
<q>If ye fulfil <hi rend='italic'>the royal law</hi> according to the scripture, Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well: but if ye have
respect of persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law
as transgressors.</q> James 2:8, 9.
</p>

<p>
2. By what law is the knowledge of sin?
</p>

<p>
<q>I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known
lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</q> Rom. 7:7.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The law which
says, <q>Thou shalt not covet,</q> is the ten

<p>
3. By what are all men to be finally judged?
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God,
and <hi rend='italic'>keep His commandments</hi>: for this is the whole duty of man.
For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every
secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</q> Eccl.
12:13, 14. <q>So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged
by <hi rend='italic'>the law of liberty</hi>.</q> James 2:12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The law which
is here called <q>the law of liberty,</q> is the law
which says, <q>Do not commit adultery</q> and <q>Do not kill,</q> for these commandments
had just been quoted in the verse immediately preceding.
In verse 8, this same law is styled <q>the royal law;</q> that is, the kingly law.
This is the law by which men are to be judged.

</p>

<p>
<q>And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one
his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and
to drink with them. And it was so, when the days of their
feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them,
and rose up early in the morning, and <hi rend='italic'>offered burnt offerings</hi>
according to the number of them all: for Job said, <hi rend='italic'>It may be that
my sons have sinned</hi>, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did
Job continually.</q> Job 1:4, 5.
</p>

<p>
6. How early was this sacrificial system known?
</p>

<p>
<q>By faith <hi rend='italic'>Abel</hi> offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice
than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous,
God testifying of his gifts.</q> Heb. 11:4. See Gen. 4:3-5; 8:20.
</p>

<p>
7. By whom was the ten commandment law proclaimed?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire</hi>: ye
heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye
heard a voice. And <hi rend='italic'>He declared unto you His covenant, which
He commanded you to perform, even ten commandments</hi>; and He
wrote them upon two tables of stone.</q> Deut. 4:12, 13.
</p>

<p>
8. How was the ceremonial law made known to Israel?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Lord called unto Moses, ... saying, <hi rend='italic'>Speak
unto the children of Israel, and say unto them</hi>, If any man of you
bring <hi rend='italic'>an offering</hi>,</q> etc.
Lev. 1:1, 2. <q><hi rend='italic'>This is the law of the
burnt offering, of the meat-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of
the trespass-offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of
the peace-offering</hi>; which the Lord commanded Moses in mount
Sinai, in the day that He commanded the children of Israel to
offer their oblations unto the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai.</q>
Lev. 7:37, 38.
</p>

<p>
9. Were the ten commandments a distinct and complete
law by themselves?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>These words the Lord spake</hi> unto all your assembly in the
mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick
darkness, with a great voice: <hi rend='italic'>and He added no more</hi>. And He
wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.</q>
Deut. 5:22. <q>And the Lord said unto Moses, Come up to
Me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee <hi rend='italic'>tables of
stone</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>a law</hi>, and
<hi rend='italic'>commandments</hi> which I have written.</q>
Ex. 24:12.
</p>

<p>
10. Was the ceremonial law a complete law in itself?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>The law</hi> of commandments
<hi rend='italic'>contained in ordinances</hi>.</q> Eph.
2:15.
</p>

<pb n='395'/><anchor id='Pg395'/>

<p>
11. On what did God write the ten commandments?
</p>

<p>
<q>And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded
you to perform, even ten commandments; and <hi rend='italic'>He wrote
them upon two tables of stone</hi>.</q> Deut. 4:13.
</p>

<p>
12. In what were the laws or commandments respecting
sacrifices and burnt offerings written?
</p>

<p>
<q>And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might
give according to the divisions of the families of the people,
to offer unto the Lord, as it is written in <hi rend='italic'>the book of Moses</hi>.</q>
2 Chron. 35:12.
</p>

<p>
13. Where were the ten commandments placed?
</p>

<p>
<q>And he took and put the testimony <hi rend='italic'>into the ark</hi>, ...
and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark.</q> Ex. 40:20.
</p>

<p>
14. Where did Moses command the Levites to put the book
of the law which he had written?
</p>

<p>
<q>Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the
covenant of the Lord, saying, Take this book of the law, and
<hi rend='italic'>put it in the side of the ark</hi> of the covenant
of the Lord your God.</q>
Deut. 31:25, 26.
</p>

<p>
15. What is the nature of the moral law?
</p>

<p>
<q>The law of the Lord is <hi rend='italic'>perfect</hi>, converting the soul.</q> Ps.
19:7. <q>For we know that the law is <hi rend='italic'>spiritual</hi>.</q> Rom. 7:14.
</p>

<p>
16. Could the offerings commanded by the ceremonial law
satisfy or make perfect the conscience of the believer?
</p>

<p>
<q>Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were
offered both gifts and sacrifices, <hi rend='italic'>that could not make him that did
the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience</hi>.</q> Heb. 9:9.
</p>

<p>
17. Until what time did the ceremonial law impose the service
performed in the worldly sanctuary?
</p>

<p>
<q>Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings,
and carnal ordinances, <hi rend='italic'>imposed on them until the time of
reformation</hi>.</q> Verse 10.
</p>

<p>
18. When was this time of reformation?
</p>

<p>
<q>But <hi rend='italic'>Christ being come</hi> an high priest of good things to come,
by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands,
that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats
and calves, but by His own blood He entered in once into the
holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</q> Verses
11, 12.
</p>

<pb n='396'/><anchor id='Pg396'/>

<p>
19. How did Christ's death affect the ceremonial law?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances</hi> that was against
us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing
it to His cross.</q> Col. 2:14. <q>Having <hi rend='italic'>abolished</hi> in His
flesh the enmity, even <hi rend='italic'>the law of commandments contained in
ordinances</hi>.</q> Eph. 2:15.
</p>

<p>
20. Why was the ceremonial law taken away?
</p>

<p>
<q>For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment
because of its weakness and unprofitableness (for the law made
nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope,
through which we draw nigh unto God.</q> Heb. 7:18, 19, R. V.
</p>

<p>
21. What miraculous event occurred at the death of Christ,
signifying that the sacrificial system was forever at an end?
</p>

<p>
<q>Jesus, when He had cried again with a loud voice, yielded
up the ghost. And, behold, <hi rend='italic'>the veil of the temple was rent in
twain</hi> from the top to the bottom.</q> Matt. 27:50, 51.
</p>

<p>
22. In what words had the prophet Daniel foretold this?
</p>

<p>
<q>And He shall confirm the covenant with many for one week:
and <hi rend='italic'>in the midst of the week He shall cause the sacrifice and the
oblation to cease</hi>.</q> Dan. 9:27.
</p>

<p>
23. How enduring is the moral law?
</p>

<p>
<q>Concerning Thy testimonies, I have known of old that
<hi rend='italic'>Thou hast founded them forever</hi>.</q> Ps. 119:152.

<p>
1. What two covenants are contrasted in the Bible?
</p>

<p>
<q>In that He saith, A <hi rend='italic'>new</hi> covenant, He hath made the first
<hi rend='italic'>old</hi>. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to
vanish away.</q> Heb. 8:13.
</p>

<p>
2. By what other terms are these covenants designated?
</p>

<p>
<q>For if that <hi rend='italic'>first</hi> covenant had been faultless, then should
no place have been sought for the <hi rend='italic'>second</hi>.</q> Verse 7.
</p>

<p>
3. In connection with what historical event was the old
covenant made?
</p>

<p>
<q>Not according to the covenant that I made with their
fathers in the day <hi rend='italic'>when I took them by the hand to lead them
out of the land of Egypt</hi>; because they continued not in My
covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</q> Verse
9. See Ex. 19:3-8.
</p>

<p>
4. When God was about to proclaim His law to Israel, of
what did He tell Moses to remind them?
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell the children of Israel; Ye have seen what I did unto
the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought
you unto Myself.</q> Ex. 19:3, 4.
</p>

<pb n='398'/><anchor id='Pg398'/>

<p>
5. What proposition did He submit to them?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now therefore, <hi rend='italic'>if ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My
covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto Me above all
people</hi>: for all the earth is Mine: and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom
of priests, and an holy nation.</q> Verses 5, 6.
</p>

<p>
6. What response did the people make to this proposition?
</p>

<p>
<q>And all the people answered together, and said, <hi rend='italic'>All that
the Lord hath spoken we will do</hi>. And Moses returned the words
of the people unto the Lord.</q> Verse 8.
</p>

<p>
7. In this covenant with Israel, what obligation was imposed
upon the people?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now therefore, if ye will <hi rend='italic'>obey My voice</hi>
indeed, and <hi rend='italic'>keep
My covenant</hi>.</q> Verse 5, first part.
</p>

<p>
8. What was the Lord's covenant which they were to keep
as their part of this covenant?
</p>

<p>
<q>And He declared unto you <hi rend='italic'>His covenant</hi>, which He commanded
you to perform, even <hi rend='italic'>ten commandments</hi>; and He wrote
them upon two tables of stone.</q> Deut. 4:13.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The ten
commandments were the <q>covenant</q> to which the
Lord referred, when, in proposing to make a covenant with Israel, He said,
<q>If ye will obey <emph>My voice</emph> indeed, and keep <emph>My covenant</emph>,</q>
etc. Ex. 19:5. The ten commandments were termed God's covenant before the covenant
was made with Israel: hence they cannot be the old covenant itself. They
were not an agreement made, but something which God commanded them
to perform, and promised blessings upon condition they were kept. Thus
the ten commandments&mdash;God's covenant&mdash;became the <emph>basis</emph> of the
covenant here made with Israel. The old covenant was made <emph>concerning</emph>
the ten commandments; or, as stated in Ex. 24:8, <q>concerning all these
words.</q> A covenant means a solemn pledge or promise based on conditions.
</quote>

<p>
9. After the law had been proclaimed from Sinai, what did
the people again say?
</p>

<p>
<q>And all the people answered with one voice, and said, <hi rend='italic'>All
the words which the Lord hath said will we do</hi>.</q> Ex. 24:3.
</p>

<p>
10. That there might be no misunderstanding, what did
Moses do?
</p>

<p>
<q>And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord, ... and
he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of
the people.</q> Verses 4-7.
</p>

<p>
11. What did the people once again promise to do?
</p>

<p>
<q>And they said, <hi rend='italic'>All that the Lord hath said will we do, and
be obedient</hi>.</q> Verse 7.
</p>

<pb n='399'/><anchor id='Pg399'/>

<p>
12. How was this covenant then confirmed and dedicated?
</p>

<p>
<q>And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which
offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen
unto the Lord. And Moses took half of the blood, and put it
in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. And
he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of
the people: and they said, All that the Lord hath said will we
do, and be obedient. And <hi rend='italic'>Moses took the blood, and sprinkled
it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which
the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words</hi>.</q> Verses
5-8.
</p>

<p>
13. How does Paul describe this dedication of the covenant?
</p>

<p>
<q>For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people
according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats,
with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and <hi rend='italic'>sprinkled both the
book, and all the people</hi>, saying, This is the blood of the testament
which God hath enjoined unto you.</q> Heb. 9:19, 20.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;We here have
the complete account of the making of the
first or old covenant. God promised to make them His peculiar people
on condition that they would keep His commandments. Three times
they promised to obey. The agreement was then ratified, or sealed, with
blood.
</quote>

<p>
14. Within less than forty days after the making of this
covenant, while Moses tarried in the mount, what did the people
say to Aaron?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Up, make us gods, which shall go before us</hi>; for as for this
Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt,
we wot not what is become of him.</q> Ex. 32:1.
</p>

<p>
15. When Moses came down from Sinai, what did he see?
</p>

<p>
<q>And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the
camp, that he saw <hi rend='italic'>the calf</hi>, and
<hi rend='italic'>the dancing</hi>: and Moses' anger
waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake
them beneath the mount.</q> Verse 19.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The great
object and secret of the old covenant is revealed
here. The people did not realize the weakness and sinfulness of their
own hearts, or their need of divine grace and help to keep the law; and so,
in their ignorance, they readily pledged obedience to it. But almost
immediately they began to commit idolatry, and thus to break the law of
God, or the very conditions laid down as their part of the covenant. In
themselves the conditions were good; but in their own strength the people
were unable to fulfil them. The great object of the old covenant therefore
was to teach the people their weakness, and their inability to keep the law
without the help of God. Like the law itself, over which the old covenant
was made, this covenant was designed to shut them up to the provisions
of the new or everlasting covenant, and lead them to Christ. Gal. 3:23,
<pb n='400'/><anchor id='Pg400'/>
24. And the lesson which Israel as a nation had to learn in this, each
individual now must learn before he can be saved. There is no salvation
for any one while trusting in self. Unaided, no one can keep the law.
Only in Christ is there either remission of sins or power to keep from sinning.
The breaking of the tables of the law signified that the terms of the
covenant had been broken; the renewing of the tables (Ex. 34:1, 28), God's
patience and long-suffering with His people.
</quote>

<p>
16. Wherein does the new covenant differ from and excel
the old?
</p>

<p>
<q>But now hath He obtained a more excellent ministry, by
how much also He is the mediator of <hi rend='italic'>a better covenant</hi>, which was
established upon <hi rend='italic'>better promises</hi>.</q> Heb. 8:6.
</p>

<p>
17. What are the <q>better promises</q> upon which the new
covenant was established?
</p>

<p>
<q>This shall be the covenant that I will make with the house
of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, <hi rend='italic'>I will put My law in
their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; ... I will
forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more</hi>.</q>
Jer. 31:33, 34. See Heb. 8:8-12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;These are simply
the blessings of the gospel through Christ.
They are promised upon condition of repentance, confession, faith, and
acceptance of Christ, the Mediator of the new covenant, which means salvation
and obedience. In the old covenant there was no provision for
pardon and power to obey. It is true there was pardon <emph>during the time of
the old covenant</emph>, but not by <emph>virtue</emph> of it. Pardon then, as now, was
through the provisions of the new covenant, the terms of which are older than the
old covenant.
</quote>

<p>
18. In what statement was Christ promised as a Saviour
and Deliverer of the race as soon as sin entered?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Lord God said unto the serpent, ... I will
put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed
and <hi rend='italic'>her seed</hi>; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise His
heel.</q> Gen. 3:14, 15.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The covenant
of grace, with its provisions of pardon and
peace, dates from the foundation of the world.
</quote>

<p>
19. To whom was this covenant-promise later renewed?
</p>

<p>
<q>And God said unto <hi rend='italic'>Abraham</hi>, ... Sarah thy wife
shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac:
and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting
covenant, and with <hi rend='italic'>his seed</hi> after him.</q> <q>I will make thy
seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, ... and in <hi rend='italic'>thy
seed</hi> shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.</q> Gen.
17:15-19; 26:4.
</p>

<p>
20. Who was the seed here referred to?
</p>

<pb n='402'/><anchor id='Pg402'/>

<p>
<q>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.
He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to
thy seed, <hi rend='italic'>which is Christ</hi>.</q> Gal. 3:16.

</p>

<p>
21. What shows that the new or second covenant and the
Abrahamic covenant are virtually the same?
</p>

<p>
<q>And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs
according to the promise.</q> Verse 29.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;No one
should allow himself to be confused by the terms
<emph>first covenant</emph> and <emph>second covenant</emph>. While the covenant made at
Sinai is called the first covenant, it is by no means the first covenant that God
ever made with man. Long before this He made a covenant with Abraham;
He also made a covenant with Noah, and with Adam. Neither must
it be supposed that the first or old covenant existed for a time as the <emph>only</emph>
covenant with mankind, and that this must serve its purpose and pass
away before any one could share in the promised blessings of the second
or new covenant. Had this been the case, then during that time there
would have been no pardon for any one. What is called the new or second
covenant virtually existed before the covenant made at Sinai; for the
covenant with Abraham was confirmed in Christ (Gal. 3:17), and it is
only through Christ that there is any value to the new or second covenant.
There is no blessing that can be gained by virtue of the new covenant that
was not promised to Abraham. And we, with whom the new covenant is
made, can share the inheritance which it promises only by being children
of Abraham, and sharing in his blessing. Gal. 3:7, 9. And since no one
can have anything except as a child of Abraham, it follows that there
is nothing in what is called the new or second covenant that was not in the
covenant made with Abraham. The second covenant existed in every
essential feature, except its ratification, long before the first, even from the
days of Adam. It is called second because its ratification occurred after
the covenant made and ratified at Sinai.
</quote>

<p>
22. What is necessary where there is a covenant?
</p>

<p>
<q>For where a covenant is, there must also of necessity be
<hi rend='italic'>the death of that which establishes it</hi>. For a covenant is made
firm over the dead victims; whereas it is of no force while that
which establisheth it liveth.</q> Heb. 9:16, 17, Boothroyd's
translation.
</p>

<p>
23. With whose blood was the new covenant dedicated?
</p>

<p>
<q>And [He took] the cup in like manner after supper, saying,
This cup is the new covenant in <hi rend='italic'>My blood</hi>, even that which is
poured out for you.</q> Luke 22:20, R. V.
</p>

<p>
24. What power is there in the blood of this covenant?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead
our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the
blood of the everlasting covenant, <hi rend='italic'>make you perfect in every good
work</hi> to do His will.</q> Heb. 13:20, 21.
</p>

<p>
25. Through which covenant only is there remission of sins?
</p>


<pb n='403'/><anchor id='Pg403'/>

<p>
<q>How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through
the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish unto God,
cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
And for this cause He is the mediator of a <hi rend='italic'>new covenant</hi>, that a
death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions
that were under the first covenant, they that have been
called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</q> Heb.
9:14, 15, R. V.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The fact
that Christ, as mediator of the second covenant,
died for the remission of the transgressions that were under the first covenant,
shows that there was no forgiveness <emph>by virtue</emph> of the first covenant.

26. Under the old covenant, what did the people promise?
</p>

<p>
To keep the law of God in their own strength.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Under
this covenant the people promised to keep all the
commandments of God in order to be His peculiar people, and this without
help from any one. This was virtually a promise to make themselves
righteous. But Christ says, <q>Without Me ye can do nothing.</q> John
15:5. And the prophet Isaiah says, <q>All our righteousnesses are as filthy
rags.</q> Isa. 64:6. The only perfect righteousness is God's righteousness,
and this can be obtained only through faith in Christ. Rom. 3:20-26.
The only righteousness that will insure an entrance into the kingdom of
God is <q>the righteousness which is of God by faith.</q> Phil. 3:9. Of those
who inherit the kingdom of God, the Lord says, <q>Their righteousness is
of Me</q> (Isa. 54:17); and the prophet Jeremiah says of Christ, <q>This is
His name whereby He shall be called, The Lord Our Righteousness.</q>
Jer. 23:6.

27. Under the new covenant, what does God promise to do?
</p>

<p>
<q>I will put My law in their inward parts, and write it in
their hearts.</q> Jer. 31:33.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The new
covenant is an arrangement for bringing man again
into harmony with the divine will, and placing him where he can keep
God's law. Its <q>better promises</q> bring forgiveness of sins, grace to renew
the heart, and power to obey the law of God. The dissolution of the old
covenant and the making of the new in no wise abrogated the law of God.

<p>
28. Where was the law of God written under the old covenant?
</p>

<p>
<q>And I made an ark of shittim-wood, and hewed <hi rend='italic'>two tables
of stone.... And He wrote on the tables ... the ten
commandments</hi>, which the Lord spake unto you in the mount
out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the
Lord gave them unto me.</q> Deut. 10:3, 4.
</p>

<p>
29. Where is the law of God written under the new covenant?
</p>

<p>
<q>But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the
house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, <hi rend='italic'>I will put My
law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts</hi>.</q> Jer. 31:33.
</p>

<pb n='404'/><anchor id='Pg404'/>

<p>
30. What reason is given for making the new covenant?
</p>

<p>
<q>For if that first covenant had been <hi rend='italic'>faultless</hi>, then should
no place have been sought for the second. For <hi rend='italic'>finding fault
with them</hi>, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when
I will make a new covenant.</q> Heb. 8:7, 8.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
chief fault in connection with the old covenant lay with
<emph>the people</emph>. They were not able, in themselves, to fulfil their part of it,
and it provided them no help for so doing. There was no Christ in it.
It was of <emph>works</emph> and not of <emph>grace</emph>.
It was valuable only as a means of impressing
upon them their sinfulness and their need of divine aid.
</quote>

<p>
31. What unites all believers under the new covenant?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles
in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is
called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; that at
that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth
of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,
having no hope, and without God in the world: <hi rend='italic'>but now in Christ
Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of
Christ</hi>.</q> Eph. 2:11-13.

<head>What Was Abolished By Christ</head>

<p rend='text-align: center'>
  <figure url='images/illus405.png' rend='width: 80%'>
    <head>The Veil Rent In Twain.
"Having abolished in His flesh ... the
law ... contained in ordinances."
Eph. 2:15.</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
1. How did Christ's death on the cross affect the whole
sacrificial system?
</p>

<p>
<q>After threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off....
And He shall confirm the covenant with many for one
week: and <hi rend='italic'>in the midst of the week He shall cause the sacrifice and
the oblation to cease</hi>.</q> Dan. 9:26, 27.
</p>

<p>
2. What did Christ nail to His cross?
</p>

<p>
<q>Blotting out <hi rend='italic'>the handwriting of ordinances</hi> that was against
us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, <hi rend='italic'>nailing
it to His cross</hi>.</q> Col. 2:14.
</p>

<p>
3. What did He thus abolish?
</p>

<p>
<q>Having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even <hi rend='italic'>the law of
commandments contained in ordinances</hi>; for to make in Himself
of twain one new man, so making peace; and that He might
reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain
the enmity thereby.</q> Eph. 2:15, 16.
</p>

<p>
4. To what did the ordinances pertain that were thus
abolished?
</p>


<pb n='406'/><anchor id='Pg406'/>

<p>
<q>Let no man therefore judge you in <hi rend='italic'>meat</hi>,
or in <hi rend='italic'>drink</hi>, or in
respect of an <hi rend='italic'>holy day</hi>, or of
the <hi rend='italic'>new moon</hi>, or of the <hi rend='italic'>sabbath
days: which are a shadow of things to come</hi>; but the body is of
Christ.</q> Col. 2:16, 17.
</p>

<p>
5. From what statement do we learn that these ordinances
related to the sacrificial system?
</p>

<p>
<q>For the law <hi rend='italic'>having a shadow of good things to come</hi>, and not
the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices
which they offered year by year continually make the comers
thereunto perfect.</q> Heb. 10:1.
</p>

<p>
6. What occurred at the time of the crucifixion which indicated
that the typical system had been taken away by Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>And, behold, <hi rend='italic'>the veil of the temple was rent in twain</hi> from the
top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent.</q>
Matt. 27:51.
</p>

<p>
7. In what language is this clearly stated?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then said He, Lo, I come to do Thy will, O God. <hi rend='italic'>He
taketh away the first, that He may establish the second.</hi></q> Heb.
10:9.
</p>

<p>
8. What is the first which He took away?
</p>

<p>
<q>Above when He said, <hi rend='italic'>Sacrifice</hi> and
<hi rend='italic'>offering</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>burnt
offerings</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>offering for sin</hi>
thou wouldest not, neither hadst
pleasure therein; which are offered by the law.</q> Verse 8.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;<q>He taketh
away the first.</q> The connection plainly indicates
that what Christ took away was ceremonialism as expressed in the
typical service of sacrifices and offerings, and that what He established, by
giving Himself to do the will of God, was the experience of doing the will of
God on the part of the believer. Thus He made possible the answer to the
petition which He taught His disciples, <q>Thy will be done in earth, as it is
in heaven.</q> Instead of abolishing the moral law, Christ made such provision
that every believer in Him may become a doer of that law.
</p>

<p>
<q>The word <hi rend='italic'>first</hi> here refers
to sacrifices and offerings. He takes <emph>them</emph>
away; that is, He shows that they are of no value in removing sin. He
states their inefficacy, and declares His purpose to abolish them.
<q><emph>That He may establish the second</emph></q>&mdash;to
wit, the doing of the will of God....
If they had been efficacious, there would have been no need of His coming
to make an atonement.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Dr. Albert Barnes, on Heb. 10:9.</hi>

<p>
9. In what statement to the woman at Jacob's well did
Jesus intimate that the ceremonial system of worship would be
abolished?
</p>

<p>
<q>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe Me, the hour cometh,
when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem,
worship the Father.</q> John 4:21.
</p>

<pb n='407'/><anchor id='Pg407'/>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The worship
of the Jews centered in the typical system, or
ritual service, of the temple, <q>at Jerusalem,</q> while the Samaritans had
instituted a rival service <q>in this mountain,</q> Mt. Gerizim. In His statement
to the woman of Samaria, Jesus therefore indicated that the time was
at hand when the whole typical system would be done away.
</quote>

<p>
10. What test case arose in the time of the apostles over
this question?
</p>

<p>
<q>And certain men which came down from Judea taught the
brethren, and said, <hi rend='italic'>Except ye be circumcised after the manner of
Moses, ye cannot be saved</hi>.</q> Acts 15:1.
</p>

<p>
11. What requirement was made by these teachers from
Judea concerning the ceremonial law?
</p>

<p>
<q>Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out
from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls,
saying, <hi rend='italic'>Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law</hi>: to whom we
gave no such commandment.</q> Verse 24.
</p>

<p>
12. After conferring over this matter, what decision was
reached by the apostles?
</p>

<p>
<q>For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay
upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; <hi rend='italic'>that
ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from
things strangled, and from fornication</hi>: from which if ye keep
yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.</q> Verses 28, 29.
</p>

<p>
13. What charge was made against Stephen concerning his
attitude toward the ceremonial law?
</p>

<p>
<q>And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth
not to speak blasphemous words against <hi rend='italic'>this
holy place</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>the
law</hi>: for we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth
shall destroy this place, and shall <hi rend='italic'>change the customs which
Moses delivered us</hi>.</q> Acts 6:13, 14.
</p>

<p>
14. What similar charge was brought against the apostle
Paul?
</p>

<p>
<q>This fellow persuadeth men to worship God <hi rend='italic'>contrary to
the law</hi>.</q> Acts 18:13.
</p>

<p>
15. What statement did Paul make concerning his faith
and manner of worship?
</p>

<p>
<q>But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they
call <hi rend='italic'>heresy</hi>, so worship I
the God of my fathers, <hi rend='italic'>believing all
things which are written in the law and in the prophets</hi>.</q> Acts
24:14.
</p>

<pb n='408'/><anchor id='Pg408'/>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The charge
against Stephen and Paul was not based upon
any violation of the moral law, but upon their teaching concerning the
ceremonial law; and Paul's admission that he was guilty of what they called
heresy meant simply that he differed from them as to the obligation to
observe any longer the precepts of the law which was imposed upon them
<q>until the time of reformation.</q> The simple fact that such charges were
preferred against these able exponents and teachers of the gospel shows
that in their view the ceremonial law had been abolished by the death of
Christ, and that, like the giving of the moral law at Sinai it was designed
to lead men to Christ.
</quote>

<p>
16. What is one of the offices of the moral law?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore the law was <hi rend='italic'>our schoolmaster to bring us unto
Christ, that we might be justified by faith</hi>.</q> Gal. 3:24.
</p>

<p>
17. How is this same teaching expressed in another place?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>Christ is the end of the law for righteousness</hi> to every
one that believeth.</q> Rom. 10:4.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Murdock's translation
of the Syriac New Testament renders
this passage: <q>For Messiah is the <emph>aim</emph> of the law, for righteousness, unto
every one that believeth in Him.</q>
</quote>

<p>
18. In what statement is there a similar use of the word end?
</p>

<p>
<q>Receiving <hi rend='italic'>the end of your faith</hi>, even the salvation of your
souls.</q> 1 Peter 1:9. See also 1 Tim. 1:5; James 5:11.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In the
ceremonial law there was <q>a shadow of good things
to come,</q> a type of the mediatorial work of Christ, our great High Priest.
The moral law makes known sin, places the sinner under condemnation,
and forces him to Christ for pardon and cleansing. The ceremonial law
was abolished by the work of Christ, but the moral law was established
by both His life and death.
</quote>

<p>
19. What testimony did Christ bear concerning His relation
to the law and the prophets?
</p>

<p>
<q>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the
prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</q> Matt.
5:17.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;<q>Christ kept
the law. If He had ever broken it, He would
have had to die for Himself; but because He was a Lamb without spot or
blemish, His atoning death is efficacious for you and me. He had no sin of
His own to atone for, and so God accepted His sacrifice. Christ is the end
of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. We are righteous
in God's sight because the righteousness of God which is by faith in
Jesus Christ is unto all and upon all them that
believe.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>Weighed and

"The law was our schoolmaster to bring us
unto Christ." Gal. 3:24.</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
1. What is one of the uses of the law?
</p>

<p>
<q>Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
justified in His sight: for <hi rend='italic'>by the law is the knowledge of sin</hi>.</q>
Rom. 3:20.
</p>

<p>
2. In thus making known sin, and the consequent need of
a Saviour, what part does the law act?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore the <hi rend='italic'>law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto
Christ</hi>, that we might be justified by faith.</q> Gal. 3:24.
</p>

<p>
3. What is the gospel declared to be?
</p>

<p>
<q>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is
<hi rend='italic'>the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth</hi>; to the
Jew first, and also to the Greek.</q> Rom. 1:16.
</p>

<p>
4. What is the significance of the name bestowed by the
angel upon the Saviour before His birth?
</p>

<p>
<q>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His
name <hi rend='italic'>Jesus</hi>: for <hi rend='italic'>He
shall save His people from their sins</hi>.</q>
Matt. 1:21.
</p>

<p>
5. In whom is this power to save from sin revealed?
</p>

<p>
<q>But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling-*block,
and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which
are called, both Jews and Greeks, <hi rend='italic'>Christ the power of God</hi>, and
the wisdom of God.</q> 1 Cor. 1:23, 24.
</p>

<p>
6. What was foretold concerning Christ's attitude toward
the law of God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is
<pb n='410'/><anchor id='Pg410'/>
written of Me, <hi rend='italic'>I delight to do Thy will, O My God: yea, Thy law
is within My heart</hi>.</q> Ps. 40:7, 8.
</p>

<p>
7. What is the first promise of the new covenant?
</p>

<p>
<q>For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
Israel after those days, saith the Lord; <hi rend='italic'>I will put My laws into
their mind, and write them in their hearts</hi>.</q> Heb. 8:10.
</p>

<p>
8. What is Christ's relation to this new covenant?
</p>

<p>
<q>But now hath He obtained a more excellent ministry, by
how much also He is the <hi rend='italic'>mediator</hi> of a better covenant, which
was established upon better promises.</q> Verse 6.
</p>

<p>
9. How is this same work for man otherwise described?
</p>

<p>
<q>For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices:
wherefore <hi rend='italic'>it is of necessity that this Man have somewhat
also to offer</hi>. For if He were on earth, He should not be a priest,
seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law.</q>
Verses 3, 4.
</p>

<p>
10. What is necessary on the part of the individual in order
to receive the benefit of Christ's work?
</p>

<p>
<q>With the heart man <hi rend='italic'>believeth</hi> unto righteousness; and with
the mouth <hi rend='italic'>confession</hi> is made unto salvation.</q> Rom. 10:10.
</p>

<p>
11. For what did the apostle Paul trust Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency
of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom
I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but
dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in Him, not having
mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which
is through the faith of Christ, <hi rend='italic'>the righteousness which is of God
by faith</hi>.</q> Phil. 3:8, 9.
</p>

<p>
12. What relation does the law sustain to this righteousness?
</p>

<p>
<q>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested,
<hi rend='italic'>being witnessed by the law</hi> and the prophets.</q> Rom.
3:21.
</p>

<p>
13. Does the faith which brings righteousness abolish the law?
</p>

<p>
<q>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid:
yea, <hi rend='italic'>we establish the law</hi>.</q> Verse 31.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The law reveals
the perfection of character required, and so
gives a knowledge of sin; but it is powerless to confer the character demanded.
In the gospel, the law, first written in the heart of Christ, becomes
<q>the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus,</q> and is thus transferred
to the heart of the believer, in whose heart Christ dwells by faith. Thus
<pb n='411'/><anchor id='Pg411'/>
the new covenant promise is fulfilled that the law shall be written in the
heart. This is the genuine experience of righteousness by faith,&mdash;a
righteousness which is witnessed by the law, and revealed in the life in
harmony with the law. The gospel is thus seen to be the provision for
restoring the law to its place in the heart and life of the one who believes
on Christ, and accepts His mediatorial work. Such faith, instead of
making void the law, establishes it in the heart of the believer. The gospel
is not against the law, therefore, but upholds, maintains, and presents the
law to us in Christ.

14. What did Christ take away?
</p>

<p>
<q>The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith,
Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away <hi rend='italic'>the sin of the world</hi>.</q>
John 1:29.

<p>
15. What has Christ abolished?
</p>

<p>
<q>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour
Jesus Christ, who hath <hi rend='italic'>abolished death</hi>, and hath brought
life and immortality to light through the gospel.</q> 2 Tim. 1:10.
</p>

<p>
16. What change is brought about through the gospel?
</p>

<p>
<q>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory
of the Lord, are <hi rend='italic'>changed into the same image</hi> from glory to glory,
even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</q> 2 Cor. 3:18.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;It is
sometimes claimed that Christ changed, abolished, or
took away the law, and put the gospel in its place; but this shows a misapprehension
of the real work of Christ. The individual believer is changed
by beholding the glory revealed in the gospel (2 Cor. 4:4; John 1:14);
death has been abolished through the death of Christ; and sin has been
taken away by the great Sin-bearer; but the law of God still remains unchanged
as the very foundation of His throne. See note on page <ref target='Pg098'>98</ref>.

shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the
judgment: but I say unto you, That <hi rend='italic'>whosoever is angry with
his brother</hi> without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment:
and whosoever shall say to his brother, <hi rend='italic'>Raca</hi>, shall be in danger
of the council: but whosoever shall say, <hi rend='italic'>Thou fool</hi>, shall be in
danger of hell-fire.</q> Matt. 5:21, 22.
</p>

<p>
18. How did He interpret the seventh commandment?
</p>

<p>
<q>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou
shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto you, That <hi rend='italic'>whosoever
looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with
her already in his heart</hi>.</q> Verses 27, 28.
</p>

<p>
19. Of what prophecy was this teaching a fulfilment?
</p>

<pb n='412'/><anchor id='Pg412'/>

<p>
<q>The Lord is well pleased for His righteousness' sake; <hi rend='italic'>He
will magnify the law, and make it honorable</hi>.</q> Isa. 42:21.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Christ not
only gave a spiritual interpretation to the law,
and Himself observed it according to that interpretation, but He showed
the holiness and the immutable nature of the law by dying on the cross to
pay the penalty of its transgression. In this way, above all, He magnified
the law, and showed its far-reaching, immutable, and imperishable nature.

<p>
20. In what promise was the gospel preached to Abraham?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the
heathen through faith, preached before <hi rend='italic'>the gospel</hi> unto Abraham,
saying, <hi rend='italic'>In thee shall all nations be blessed</hi>.</q> Gal. 3:8.
</p>

<p>
21. On what basis was Abraham accounted righteous?
</p>

<p>
<q>For what saith the scripture? <hi rend='italic'>Abraham believed God, and
it was counted unto him for righteousness.</hi></q> Rom. 4:3.
</p>

<p>
22. What scripture cuts off all hope of justification by works?
</p>

<p>
<q>Therefore <hi rend='italic'>by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified
in His sight</hi>: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</q> Rom.
3:20.
</p>

<p>
23. In what way are all believers in Jesus justified?
</p>

<p>
<q>Being <hi rend='italic'>justified freely by His grace</hi> through the redemption
that is in Christ Jesus.</q> Verse 24.
</p>

<p>
24. After this work of grace has been accomplished, is the
believer expected to go on in sin?
</p>

<p>
<q>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that
grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead
to sin, live any longer therein?</q> Rom. 6:1, 2.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Even in the
days of Abraham the same gospel of righteousness
by faith was preached as now, while the law made known sin, and witnessed
to the righteousness obtained through faith, just as it has done since
the cross. From this it is evident that the relation between the law and
the gospel has always been the same.
</quote>

<p>
25. What was Christ's personal attitude toward the law?
</p>

<p>
<q>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:

ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love; even

</p>

<p>
26. What scripture shows that God's remnant people will
have a right conception of the proper relation between the law
and the gospel?

<p>
1. When and by whom was the Sabbath made?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thus the heavens and the earth, were finished, and all the
host of them. And <hi rend='italic'>on the seventh day God ended His work</hi> which
He had made; <hi rend='italic'>and He rested on the seventh day</hi> from all His work
which He had made.</q> Gen. 2:1, 2.
</p>

<p>
2. After resting on the seventh day, what did God do?
</p>

<p>
<q>And God <hi rend='italic'>blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it</hi>: because
that in it He had rested from all His work which God created
and made.</q> Verse 3.
</p>

<p>
3. By what three distinct acts, then, was the Sabbath made?
</p>

<p>
God <hi rend='italic'>rested</hi> on it; He
<hi rend='italic'>blessed</hi> it; He <hi rend='italic'>sanctified</hi> it.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='italic'>Sanctify</hi>: <q>To make sacred or
holy; to set apart to a holy or religious
use.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Webster.</hi>
</quote>

<p>
4. Did Christ have anything to do with creation and the
making of the Sabbath?
</p>

<p>
<q>All things were made <hi rend='italic'>by Him</hi>;
and <hi rend='italic'>without Him was not
anything made that was made</hi>.</q> John 1:3. See also Eph. 3:9;
Col. 1:16; Heb. 1:2.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Christ, being the
active agent in creation, must have rested
on the seventh day with the Father. It is therefore His rest day as well
as the Father's.
</quote>

<p>
5. For whom does Christ say the Sabbath was made?
</p>

<pb n='416'/><anchor id='Pg416'/>

<p>
<q>And He said unto them, <hi rend='italic'>The Sabbath was made for man</hi>,
and not man for the Sabbath.</q> Mark 2:27.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;It was
not made for the Jews alone. The Jews derive their
name from Judah, one of the twelve sons of Jacob, from whom they are
descended. The Sabbath was made more than two thousand years before
there was a Jew. When Paul says, <q>Neither was the man created for the
woman; but the woman for the man</q> (1 Cor. 11:9), we understand him
to mean that marriage was ordained of God for all men. So likewise with
the Sabbath. It was made for the race.
</quote>

<p>
6. What does the Sabbath commandment require?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.</hi> Six days shalt
thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the
Sabbath of the Lord thy God: <hi rend='italic'>in it thou shalt not do any work</hi>,
thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man servant, nor thy
maid servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within
thy gates.</q> Ex. 20:8-10.
</p>

<p>
7. What reason is given in the commandment for keeping
the Sabbath day holy?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and
all that in them is, and rested the seventh day</hi>: wherefore the Lord
blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</q> Verse 11.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The Sabbath
is the memorial of creation, and the sign of
God's creative power. Through the keeping of it God designed that man
should forever remember Him as the true and living God, the Creator of
all things.
</quote>

<p>
8. Did God bless and sanctify the seventh day while He was
resting upon it, or when His rest on that day was past?
</p>

<p>
<q>And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: <hi rend='italic'>because
that in it He <hi rend='smallcaps'>had</hi> rested from all His work</hi> which God
created and made.</q> Gen. 2:3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;God blessed
and sanctified the seventh day then future,
answering to the day on which He had just rested. The acts of blessing
and sanctifying involve the idea of a future use of those things which are
blessed and sanctified. Past time cannot be used. It is gone forever.
The blessing and sanctification of the day, therefore, must have related
to the future&mdash;to all the future seventh days.
</p>

<p>
In Joel 1:14 we read: <q>Sanctify [i.e., appoint] ye a fast, call a solemn
assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the
house of the Lord.</q> Wherever used in the Bible, the word sanctify means
to appoint, to proclaim, or to set apart, as in the margin of Joshua 20:7;
2 Kings 10:20, 21; Zeph. 1:7. So when the Sabbath was sanctified, as the
last act by which it was made for man, an appointment, or proclamation,
of the Sabbath was given. See Ex. 19:23.
</p>

<p>
<q>If we had no other passage than this of Gen. 2:3, there would be no
difficulty in deducing from it a precept for the universal observance of a
Sabbath, or seventh day, to be devoted to God as holy time, by all of that
race for whom the earth and its nature were specially prepared. The
<pb n='417'/><anchor id='Pg417'/>
first men must have known it. The words <hi rend='italic'>He hallowed it</hi> can have no
meaning otherwise. They would be a blank unless in reference to some
who were required to keep it holy.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Lange's
Commentary, Vol. I, page 197.</hi>
</p>
</quote>

<p>
9. How did God prove Israel in the wilderness?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, <hi rend='italic'>I will rain bread
from heaven for you</hi>; and the people shall go out and gather a
certain rate every day, <hi rend='italic'>that I may prove them, whether they will
walk in My law, or no</hi>.</q> Ex. 16:4.
</p>

<p>
10. On which day was a double portion of manna gathered?
</p>

<p>
<q>And it came to pass, that <hi rend='italic'>on the sixth day they gathered
twice as much bread</hi>, two omers for one man: and all the rulers
of the congregation came and told Moses.</q> Verse 22.
</p>

<p>
11. What reply did Moses make to the rulers?
</p>

<p>
<q>And he said unto them, <hi rend='italic'>This is that which the Lord hath
said, Tomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath</hi> unto the Lord.</q>
Verse 23.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This was a full
month and more before they came to Sinai.
</quote>

<p>
12. <hi rend='italic'>When</hi> had God <hi rend='italic'>said</hi> this?
</p>

<p>
In the beginning, when He sanctified the Sabbath. Gen. 2:3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In the wilderness
of Sin, before Israel came to Sinai, Moses
said to Jethro, his father-in-law, <q>I do make them
know the <hi rend='italic'>statutes</hi> of God,
and His <hi rend='italic'>laws</hi></q> (Ex. 18:16),
which shows that these statutes and laws existed
before they were proclaimed on Sinai.
</quote>

<p>
13. What did some of the people do on the seventh day?
</p>

<p>
<q>It came to pass, that <hi rend='italic'>there went out some of the people on the
seventh day for to gather</hi>, and they found none.</q> Ex. 16:27.
</p>

<p>
14. How did God reprove their disobedience?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Lord said unto Moses, <hi rend='italic'>How long refuse ye to keep
My commandments and My laws?</hi></q> Verse 28.
</p>

<p>
15. Why was double manna given on the sixth day?
</p>

<p>
<q>See, <hi rend='italic'>for that the Lord hath given you the Sabbath, therefore
He giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days</hi>; abide ye every
man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh
day.</q> Verse 29.
</p>

<p>
16. How, then, did the Lord prove the people (verse 4)
whether they would keep His law, or not?
</p>

<p>
Over the keeping of the Sabbath.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Thus we see
that the Sabbath commandment was a part of
God's law before this law was spoken from Sinai; for this incident occurred
in the wilderness of Sin, before the children of Israel came to Sinai, where
the law was given. Both the Sabbath and the law existed from creation.

</p>

<p>
<q>And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your

Eze. 20:20.

<p>
8. How long was the Sabbath to be a sign of the true God?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever</hi>:
for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh
day He rested, and was refreshed.</q> Ex. 31:17.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;It is manifest that
if the object of the Sabbath was to keep
God as the Creator in mind, and it had been faithfully kept from the first,
there would not now be a heathen or an idolater on the face of the earth.
</quote>

<p>
9. What besides creation were Israel to remember when
they kept the Sabbath?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt,
and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty
hand and by a stretched-out arm</hi>: therefore the Lord thy God
commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day.</q> Deut. 5:15.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;There
is a deep significance to this scripture not apparent
to those unacquainted with the facts. In Egypt, through oppression and
idolatrous surroundings, the keeping of the Sabbath had become not only
almost obsolete, but well-nigh impossible. See reading on <q>Reasons for
Sabbath-Keeping,</q> under questions 9 and 10, page <ref target='Pg423'>423</ref>.
Their deliverance
from bondage was in order that they might keep God's law (Ps. 105:43-45),
and particularly the Sabbath, the great seal, sign, and memorial-institution
of the law. The recollection of their bondage and oppressed condition
in Egypt was to be an additional incentive for keeping the Sabbath in the
land of freedom. The Sabbath, therefore, besides being a memorial of
<pb n='420'/><anchor id='Pg420'/>
creation, was to be to them a memorial of their deliverance from bondage,
and of the great power of God as manifested in this deliverance. And as
Egypt stands as a symbol of the condition of every one in the world under
the slavery of sin, so the Sabbath is to be kept by every saved soul as a
memorial of the deliverance from this slavery by the mighty power of God
through Christ.
</quote>

<p>
10. Of what else does God say He gave the Sabbath to His
people to be a sign, or reminder?
</p>

<p>
<q>Moreover also I gave them My Sabbaths, to be <hi rend='italic'>a sign</hi> between
Me and them, <hi rend='italic'>that they might know that I am the Lord
that sanctify them</hi>.</q> Eze. 20:12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Sanctification is
a work of redemption,&mdash;of making holy
sinful or unholy beings. Like the work of creation itself, this requires
creative power. See Ps. 51:10; John 3:3, 6; Eph. 2:10. And as the
Sabbath is the appropriate sign or memorial of the creative power of God
wherever displayed, whether in creation, deliverance from human bondage,
or deliverance from the slavery of sin, it is to be kept as a sign of the work
of sanctification. This will be one great reason for the saints' keeping it
throughout eternity. It will remind them not only of their own creation
and the creation of the universe, but also of their redemption.
</quote>

<p>
11. Through whom do we have sanctification?
</p>

<p>
<q>But of Him are ye in <hi rend='italic'>Christ Jesus</hi>, who of God is made unto
us wisdom, and righteousness, and <hi rend='italic'>sanctification</hi>,
and redemption.</q>
1 Cor. 1:30.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Then, as
the Sabbath is a sign or memorial of sanctification,
and as Christ is the one through whom the work of sanctification is accomplished,
the Sabbath is a sign or memorial of what Christ is to the believer.
Through the Sabbath, therefore, God designed that the believer and Christ
should be very closely linked together.
</quote>

<p>
12. What statement of the redeemed shows that they will
remember God's creative power?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and
power: <hi rend='italic'>for Thou hast created all things</hi>, and for Thy pleasure
they are and were <hi rend='italic'>created</hi>.</q> Rev. 4:11.
</p>

<p>
13. How often will they congregate to worship the Lord?
</p>

<p>
<q>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will
make, shall remain before Me, saith the Lord, so shall your
seed and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that
<hi rend='italic'>from one new moon to another</hi>,
and <hi rend='italic'>from one Sabbath to another</hi>,
shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the Lord.</q>
Isa. 66:22, 23.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The Sabbath, which
is the memorial of God's creative power,
will never cease to exist. When this sinful state of things shall give way
to the sinless new earth, the fact upon which the Sabbath institution is
based will still remain; and those who shall be permitted to live in the new
earth will still commemorate the creative power of God, while singing the
song of Moses and the Lamb. Rev. 15:3. See Rev. 22:1, 2.

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;The
Sabbath is the great memorial of creation and of God's
creative power, a constant reminder of the true and living God. God's
design in making the Sabbath, and in commanding that it be kept holy,
was that man might never forget Him, the Creator of all things.
</p>

<p>
<q>The original Sabbath being a perpetual memorial of God, the Creator
calling man to imitate God in the observance of the same, man could not
keep the original Sabbath and forget God.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Prof.

<p>
When we remember that two thirds of the world's inhabitants today
are idolaters, and that since the fall, idolatry, with its train of associated
and resultant evils, has ever been a prevailing sin, and then think that the
observance of the Sabbath, as God ordained it, would have prevented all
this, we can better appreciate the value of the Sabbath institution, and the
importance of Sabbath-keeping.

hallow it, or keep it holy?
</p>

<p>
<q>And hallow My Sabbaths; and <hi rend='italic'>they shall be a sign between
Me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God</hi>.</q>

His commandments, and His judgments, and His statutes.</q>
Deut. 8:11.

<p>
8. What other reason is given for keeping the Sabbath?
</p>

<p>
<q>Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep: <hi rend='italic'>for it is a sign between
Me and you</hi> throughout your generations; <hi rend='italic'>that ye may know that
I am the Lord that doth <hi rend='smallcaps'>sanctify</hi> you</hi>.</q> Ex. 31:13.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;To
sanctify is to make holy, or to set apart for a holy use.
The sanctification, or making holy, of sinful beings can be wrought only
by the creative power of God through Christ by the Holy Spirit. In 1
Cor. 1:30 we are told that Christ is made unto us <q>sanctification;</q> and in
Eph. 2:10 it is said that <q>we are His workmanship, <emph>created</emph> in Christ Jesus
unto good works.</q> The Sabbath, therefore, is a sign of sanctification, and
thus of what Christ is to the believer, because it is a reminder of the creative
power of God as manifested in the work of regeneration. It is the sign
of the power of God, therefore, in both creation and redemption. To the
believer, it is the evidence, or sign, that he knows the true God, who,
through Christ, created all things, and who, through Christ, redeems the
sinner and makes him whole.

9. What special reason did the Israelites have for keeping
the Sabbath?
</p>

<pb n='423'/><anchor id='Pg423'/>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt,
and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty
hand and by a stretched-out arm</hi>: therefore the Lord thy God
commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day.</q> Deut. 5:15.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In their
bondage the Israelites had to some extent lost the
knowledge of God, and departed from His precepts. The Sabbath came
to be greatly disregarded by them; and in consequence of the oppression
of the Pharaohs, especially the Pharaoh of the exodus, as witnessed by
the rigorous exactions made upon them by this latter king through their
taskmasters, its observance was made apparently impossible. See Ex.
5:1-19. The special point, both of reform and of conflict, just preceding
their deliverance from bondage, was over the matter of Sabbath observance.
Moses and Aaron had shown them that obedience to God was the first condition
of deliverance. Their efforts to restore the observance of the Sabbath
among the Israelites had come to the notice of Pharaoh; hence his
accusation against them, <q>Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, <emph>let</emph> [hinder]
the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.... Behold,
the people of the land are many, and ye make them <emph>rest</emph>
[Heb., <foreign lang='he' rend='italic'>Shabbath</foreign>]
from their burdens.</q> Ex. 5:4, 5. Deliverance from this oppression
was indeed, therefore, an additional and special reason for their keeping
the Sabbath. But Egypt and Egyptian bondage simply represent sin and
the bondage of sin. See Rev. 11:8; Hosea 11:1; Matt. 2:15; Zech. 10:10.
Every one, therefore, who has been delivered from sin has the same
reason for keeping the Sabbath as had the Israelites who were released from
Egyptian bondage.

<p>
10. What does the psalmist say was the reason why God
brought His people out of Egypt, and placed them in Canaan?
</p>

<p>
<q>And He brought forth His people with joy, and His chosen
with gladness: and gave them the lands of the heathen: ...
<hi rend='italic'>that they might observe His statutes, and keep His laws</hi>.</q> Ps.
105:43-45.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Their
deliverance from Egyptian bondage was a reason for
the keeping not only of the fourth commandment, but of every precept
of God's law. This is indicated by the preface or preamble to the law as
given on Sinai: <q>I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of
the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other
gods before Me,</q> etc. Ex. 20:2, 3. See also Lev. 19:35-37; Deut. 10:19;
15:12-15; 24:17, 18. Likewise, every one who, through Christ, has
been delivered from the bondage of sin, God calls to obedience, not only
in the matter of Sabbath-keeping, but to every precept of His holy law.
<q>Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold
on it; that <emph>keepeth the Sabbath</emph> from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from
doing <emph>any</emph> evil.</q> Isa. 56:2.

<p>
11. What is the meaning of the word sabbath?
</p>

<p>
Rest.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Previous to the
fall, God designed that man's time should
be occupied with pleasant, invigorating, but not wearisome labor. Gen.
2:15. Laborious, wearisome toil came in consequence of sin. Gen. 3:17-19.
While under the fall the Sabbath, therefore, may bring physical
rest to both man and the beasts of burden (Ex. 23:12) in a way not originally
intended, physical rest was not its original and primary design or
purpose. Cessation from the ordinary labors and occupations of the
<pb n='424'/><anchor id='Pg424'/>
week was ordained, not because these are wrong or sinful in themselves,
but that man might have an appointed time and a frequently recurring
period for the contemplation of the Creator and His works. Under the
gospel, the Sabbath is a sign of spiritual rest and freedom from sin. So we
read, <q>For he that is entered into His rest, he also hath ceased from his
own works, as God did from His.</q> Heb. 4:10.
</quote>

<p>
12. Who gives this rest from sin?
</p>

<p>
<q>Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and
<hi rend='italic'>I will give you rest</hi>. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me;
for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto
your souls.</q> Matt. 11:28, 29.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

Sabbath, then, is the sign of the soul-rest which Christ
gives to the weary and ladened with sin.

<p>
13. Was the Sabbath intended as a day for public worship?
</p>

<p>
<q>Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the

</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
14. Does the New Testament teach the same duty?
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to
good works: <hi rend='italic'>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together</hi>, as
the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so
much the more, as ye see the day approaching.</q> Heb. 10:24, 25.

15. What does Malachi say of those that fear the Lord?

<p>
<q>Then they that feared the Lord <hi rend='italic'>spake often one to another</hi>:

was written before Him for them that feared the Lord,
and that thought upon His name. And they shall be Mine,
saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up My jewels;
and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth

<p>
16. Will the Sabbath be observed as a day of worship in the

and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from
one new moon to another, and <hi rend='italic'>from one Sabbath to another, shall
all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the Lord</hi>.</q> Isa. 66:22,

<p>
<q>Remember the Sabbath day, <hi rend='italic'>to keep it holy</hi>.</q> Verse 8.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;All through
the week the keeping holy of the Sabbath day
is to be remembered, or borne in mind. No business contracts or arrangements
are to be made, no manner of living indulged in, which will prevent
or interfere with the proper or holy observance of the day when it comes.
The keeping of this commandment, therefore, is in the interests of, and
with a view to, holy living <emph>all the time</emph>. The
<emph>commandment itself</emph> enjoins a
duty, and is to be kept, all through the week; the <emph>Sabbath</emph> is to be kept
when it comes. The Sabbath commandment, therefore, like every other
precept of the decalogue, but contrary to the conception of many, is to be
kept <emph>all the time</emph>, and not simply one day in the week. In this matter we
should distinguish between the <emph>Sabbath</emph> and the Sabbath
<emph>commandment</emph>.

<q>And the <hi rend='italic'>evening</hi> and the morning were the first day.</q>

<q><hi rend='italic'>From even unto even</hi>, shall ye celebrate your Sabbath.</q>
Lev. 23:32.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;One great
advantage of keeping the Sabbath according to
the Bible method of reckoning the day, that is, from sunset to sunset, over
keeping it according to the Roman reckoning, or from midnight to midnight,
is that by the former one is awake to welcome and to bid adieu to the
day when it comes and goes, while by the latter he is asleep when the day
begins and ends. God's ways are always best. The setting of the sun is
a great natural sign for marking the division of time into days.

<p>
<q>Six days shalt thou labor, and do all <hi rend='italic'>thy work</hi>.</q> Ex. 20:9.
</p>

10. Is any of this kind of work to be done on the Sabbath?

11. How does the Lord, through the prophet Isaiah, indicate
what is true Sabbath-keeping?
</p>

<p>
<q>If thou <hi rend='italic'>turn away thy foot
from the Sabbath</hi>, from doing <hi rend='italic'>thy
pleasure</hi> on My holy day; and <hi rend='italic'>call the Sabbath a delight, the holy
of the Lord, honorable</hi>; and shalt <hi rend='italic'>honor Him, not doing thine own
ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own
words</hi>: then shalt thou <hi rend='italic'>delight
thyself in the Lord</hi>; and I will cause
thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee
with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord
hath spoken it.</q> Isa. 58:13, 14.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;<q>Whether
the Sabbath becomes a delight or a burden depends
upon the spirit with which a man meets it. Indeed, the spirit of
the man settles the question as to the benefits to come from any duty he
may perform. One man cannot understand why his neighbor should prefer
the park or the ball ground to the church, simply because his spirit is
different. He has cultivated the higher nature until he loves spiritual
things above all others, and to him the Sabbath is indeed a delight. It
comes to his weary soul as a reminder of God, and brings him nearer to
heaven in heart and mind than does any other
day.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Sabbath Recorder,

</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;God designed
that the Sabbath should direct the minds of
men to His created works, and through these to Him, the Creator. Nature
itself speaks to our senses, telling us that there is a God, the Creator and
Supreme Ruler of the universe. The Sabbath, ever pointing to God
through nature, was designed to keep the Creator constantly in mind.
The proper keeping of it, therefore, must naturally tend to prevent idolatry,
atheism, agnosticism, infidelity, irreligion, and irreverence; and, being
promotive of the knowledge and fear of God, must of necessity be a deterrent
to sin. In this may its value and importance be seen.

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;The
Sabbath should not be a day of either ordinary labor,
idleness, or amusement, but one of rest, reflection, holy joy, worship, and
helpfulness. It should be the happiest, the brightest, and the best of all
the week. Such it should be made for young and old. Very early the
children can be taught the stories of creation and redemption, and taken
out amid the handiworks of God and taught to see Him and to commune
with Him through nature. Preparation for the Sabbath, therefore, is an
essential to its proper observance. God's blessing is upon the first moments
of the Sabbath as well as upon the last; and, as far as possible, everything
should be got in readiness so that the entire day may be devoted to
God and humanity in the manner indicated.
</p>

<p>
In making the Sabbath, God rested upon, blessed, and sanctified the
day. Ex. 20:11. Whoever, then, keeps the Sabbath aright, may expect
that there will be brought into his life God's <emph>rest</emph>,
<emph>blessing</emph>, and <emph>sanctification</emph>.

<p>
3. Did Christ, while on earth, keep the Sabbath?
</p>

<p>
<q>As His custom was, <hi rend='italic'>He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
day, and stood up for to read</hi>.</q> Luke 4:16.
</p>

<p>
4. Although Lord, Maker, and an observer of the Sabbath,
how was He watched and spied upon by the scribes and Pharisees
on this day?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the scribes and Pharisees watched Him, <hi rend='italic'>whether He
would heal on the Sabbath day</hi>; that they might find an accusation
against Him.</q> Luke 6:7.
</p>

<p>
5. With what question did Christ meet their false ideas and
reasonings regarding Sabbath-keeping?
</p>

<pb n='431'/><anchor id='Pg431'/>

<p>
<q>Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; <hi rend='italic'>Is
it lawful on the Sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life,
or to destroy it?</hi></q> Verse 9.
</p>

<p>
6. How did they manifest their displeasure at His healing
the man with the withered hand on the Sabbath?
</p>

<p>
<q>And they were <hi rend='italic'>filled with
madness</hi>; and <hi rend='italic'>communed one with
another what they might do to Jesus</hi>.</q> Verse 11. <q>And the
Pharisees went forth, and straightway <hi rend='italic'>took counsel with the
Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him</hi>.</q> Mark
3:6.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;They were
angry because, notwithstanding the fact that by
the miracle performed Christ had given evidence that He was from God,
He had shown no respect for <emph>their views of Sabbath-keeping</emph>, but, on the
contrary, had shown these to be <emph>wrong</emph>. Wounded pride, obstinacy, and
malice, therefore, combined to fill them with <emph>madness</emph>; and they went out
immediately and held council with the Herodians,&mdash;their political enemies
with whom they disagreed in the matter of paying tribute to a foreign
power,&mdash;for the purpose of accomplishing His death.

<p>
7. Because Jesus healed a man on the Sabbath day, and
told him to take up his bed and walk, what did the Jews do?
</p>

<p>
<q>Therefore did the Jews <hi rend='italic'>persecute
Jesus</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>sought to slay
Him</hi>, because He had done these things on the Sabbath day.</q>
John 5:16.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;It is
a fact worthy of note that over the question of proper
Sabbath observance the Jews not only <emph>persecuted</emph> Jesus, but <emph>first took
counsel to kill Him</emph>. Not the least of the malice which finally culminated
in His crucifixion, was engendered over this very question of Sabbath observance.
Christ did not keep the Sabbath according to their ideas of
Sabbath-keeping, and so they sought to kill Him. And they are not
alone. Many today are cherishing this same spirit. Because some do not
agree with their ideas regarding the Sabbath, or Sabbath observance, they
seek to persecute and oppress them,&mdash;seek laws, and alliances with political
powers, to compel respect for their views.
</quote>

<p>
8. How did Jesus answer them?
</p>

<p>
<q>But Jesus answered them, <hi rend='italic'>My Father worketh hitherto, and
I work</hi>.</q> Verse 17.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The ordinary operations
of nature, as manifested in God's
almighty, upholding, beneficent, and healing power, go on on the Sabbath
the same as on other days; and to cooperate with God and nature in the
work of healing, relieving, and restoring on the Sabbath, cannot, therefore,
be out of harmony with God's will, nor a violation of His Sabbath law.
</quote>

<p>
9. What effect did this answer have upon the Jews?
</p>

<p>
<q>Therefore the Jews <hi rend='italic'>sought the more to kill Him</hi>, because
He not only had broken the Sabbath [i.e., in their estimation],
but said also that God was His Father, making Himself equal
with God.</q> Verse 18.

<p>
10. Because the disciples plucked a few ears of corn on the
Sabbath day to satisfy hunger, what accusation did the Pharisee
make against them to Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Pharisees said unto Him, <hi rend='italic'>Behold, why do they on
the Sabbath day that which is not lawful?</hi></q> Mark 2:24.
</p>

<p>
11. What was Christ's reply?
</p>

<p>
<q>And He said unto them, Have ye never read what David
did, when he had need, and was an hungered, he, and they that
were with him? how he went into the house of God in the days
of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the showbread, which
is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them
which were with him? And He said unto them, <hi rend='italic'>The Sabbath was
made for man, and not man for the Sabbath</hi>.</q> Verses 25-27.
</p>

<p>
12. Because of Christ's healing a woman of an infirmity on
the Sabbath, what did the ruler of a certain synagogue say?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation,
because that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath day, and said unto
the people, <hi rend='italic'>There are six days in which men ought to work: in
them therefore come and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day</hi>.</q>
Luke 13:14.
</p>

<p>
13. How did Christ answer him?
</p>

<p>
<q>The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite,
doth not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or his ass
from the stall, and lead him away to watering? and ought not
this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath
bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the
Sabbath day?</q> Verses 15, 16.
</p>

<p>
14. What effect did Christ's answers have upon the people?
</p>

<p>
<q>And when He had said these things, <hi rend='italic'>all His adversaries
were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things
that were done by Him</hi>.</q> Verse 17.
</p>

<p>
15. By what method of reasoning did Christ justify acts
of mercy on the Sabbath day?
</p>

<p>
<q>Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit,
and will not straightway pull him out on the Sabbath day?
And they could not answer Him again to these things.</q> Luke
14:5, 6. <q>What man shall there be among you, that shall have
one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath day, will he
not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much then is a man
better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the
Sabbath days.</q> Matt. 12:11, 12.

16. Into what perplexity did Christ's working of miracles
on the Sabbath throw the Pharisees?
</p>

<p>
<q>Therefore said some of the Pharisees, <hi rend='italic'>This man is not of
God, because He keepeth not the Sabbath day</hi>. Others said, <hi rend='italic'>How
can a man that is a sinner do such miracles?</hi> And <hi rend='italic'>there was a
division among them</hi>.</q> John 9:16.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The working
of these wonderful, beneficent, and gracious
miracles on the Sabbath was an evidence that Christ was from God, and
that His views of Sabbath-keeping were right. By these miracles God
was setting the seal of His approval to Christ's views and teachings respecting
the Sabbath, and to His manner of observing it, and thus condemning
the narrow and false views of the Pharisees. Hence the division.
</quote>

<p>
17. According to Isaiah, what was Christ to do with the law?
</p>

<p>
<q>He will <hi rend='italic'>magnify</hi> the law,
and <hi rend='italic'>make it honorable</hi>.</q> Isa.
42:21.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;In nothing,
perhaps, was this more strikingly fulfilled than
in the matter of Sabbath observance. By their traditions, numerous
regulations, and senseless restrictions the Jews had made the Sabbath a
burden, and anything but a delight. Christ removed all these, and by
His life and teachings put the Sabbath back in its proper place and setting,
as a day of worship and beneficence, a day for doing acts of charity and
mercy, as well as engaging in contemplation of God and in acts of devotion.
Thus He magnified it and made it honorable. One of the most prominent
features of Christ's whole ministry was this great work of <emph>Sabbath reform</emph>.
Christ did not <emph>abolish</emph> the Sabbath, nor <emph>change</emph> the Sabbath; but
He did rescue it from the rubbish of tradition, the false ideas, and the superstitions
with which it had been buried, and by which it had been degraded and
turned aside from the channel of blessing and practical service to man
designed by its Maker. The Pharisees had placed the institution <emph>above</emph>
man, and <emph>against</emph> man. Christ reversed the order, and said, <q>The Sabbath
was made <emph>for man</emph>, and not man <emph>for the Sabbath</emph>.</q> He showed
that it was to minister to the happiness, the comfort, and the well-being of both
man and beast.
</p>

<p>
Because of the false ideas which the Jews held concerning the Sabbath
and its observance, and the conflict which Christ had with them in consequence,
many of the professed followers of Christ a little later were led
into the error of rejecting the Sabbath itself as Jewish, and, without any
divine command or Scripture warrant, to substitute another day in its place.
</p>
</quote>

<p>
18. Knowing that the unbelieving Jews would still cling to
their false ideas respecting the Sabbath, and that flight from
Jerusalem and Judea on that day would be attended with difficulty,
for what, in view of the coming destruction and desolation
of the city and people, did Christ tell His disciples to pray?
</p>

<p>
<q>But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, <hi rend='italic'>neither
on the Sabbath day</hi>.</q> Matt. 24:20.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Christ's
experience with the Jews, the chosen and professed
people of God at that time, respecting the Sabbath is but a type of what,
according to prophecy, is to occur in the last days. Already it is beginning
to find its parallel in the movement to enforce Sunday observance by
law. See readings on pages <ref target='Pg271'>271</ref>,

10. What was Paul's manner respecting the Sabbath?

<p>
<q>They came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the

Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the Scriptures</hi>.</q> Acts

to attend religious services on the Sabbath.

<p>
11. How did the apostle spend the working days of the week
when at Corinth?
</p>

<p>
<q>After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came
to Corinth; and found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in
Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; ...

<hi rend='italic'>wrought</hi>: for by their

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Here,
then, were seventy-eight Sabbaths on which Paul
preached in one city. The record further says that he worked at his trade,
and we may justly infer that Paul worked at tent-making just as many
Sundays as he preached Sabbaths. If to these seventy-eight Sabbaths we
add the three he spent at Thessalonica, the one at Philippi, and the two at
Antioch, we have a record of eighty-four Sabbaths on which the apostle
held religious services, while, so far as the record shows, he held only one
meeting on the first day of the week, and that a night meeting, immediately
following the Sabbath. See Acts 20. Evidently Sunday was not the
Sabbath in Paul's day.

</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;From
beginning to end, the Bible recognizes but one weekly
Sabbath,&mdash;the day upon which God rested in the beginning; which was
made known to Israel at Sinai (Neh. 9:13, 14); was observed by Christ
and His apostles; and is to be kept by the redeemed in the world to come.
Isa. 66:22, 23.
</p>

<p>
The terms Sabbath, Sabbaths, and Sabbath days occur sixty times in
the New Testament, and in every case but one refer to the seventh day.
In Col. 2:16, 17, reference is made to the annual sabbaths connected with
the three annual feasts observed by Israel before the first advent of Christ.
</p>

<p>
The first day of the week is mentioned but eight times in the New
Testament, six of which are found in the four Gospels, and refer to the day
on which Christ arose from the dead. See Matt. 28:1; Mark 16:2, 9;
Luke 24:1; John 20:1, 19. The other two (Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 16:2) refer
to the only religious meeting held on the first day of the week after the
ascension, in apostolic times, recorded in the New Testament, and to a
systematic accounting and laying by in store at home on that day for the
poor saints in Judea and Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
It is evident, therefore, that the Sabbath of the New Testament is the
same as the Sabbath of the Old Testament, and that there is nothing in the
New Testament setting aside the seventh-day Sabbath, and putting the
first day of the week in its place.

of the seventh day as the Sabbath. But the practise of most Christians
is different; they keep the first day of the week instead, many of them believing
that Christ changed the Sabbath. But, from His own words, we
see that He came for no such purpose. The responsibility for this change
must therefore be looked for elsewhere.

<q>Opposition to Judaism introduced the particular festival

The festival of Sunday, like all other festivals, was always
only a human ordinance, and it was far from the intentions
of the apostles to establish a divine command in this
respect, far from them, and from the early apostolic church,
to transfer the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday. Perhaps at the
end of the second century a false application of this kind had
begun to take place; for men appear by that time to have considered
laboring on Sunday as a sin.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Neander's <q>Church

No; none of them.

<quote rend='display'>

second commandment forbids the making of and bowing
down to images, but does not in itself reveal who the true God is. The
third commandment says, <q>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy
God in vain,</q> but it likewise fails to reveal the true God and giver of the
law. A worshiper of the sun might say he kept this commandment so far
as it itself reveals what god is meant. So of the other commandments

nor thy maid servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is
within thy gates: for in six days <hi rend='italic'>the Lord made heaven and earth,

the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</q>

the seal of God; and the Sabbath itself, the observance of which is
enjoined by the commandment, is inseparably connected with this seal;
it is to be kept in memory of the fact that God is the Creator of all

<hi rend='italic'>having the seal of the living God</hi>: and he cried with a loud voice
to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and
the sea, saying, <hi rend='italic'>Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees,

God ordained it to be kept, holy, and in holiness, is <emph>a sign</emph> of this same
thing&mdash;perfection of character. When this seal is finally placed upon
God's people, it will be an evidence that His grace and His sanctifying
power have done their work, and fitted them for heaven. In the world to
come, all will keep the Sabbath, and will therefore have this seal or mark
of sanctification, holiness, and perfection of character. Isa. 66:22, 23.

</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;No other
day of the week in all the Bible is claimed by God
as His day. During the second, third, and fourth centuries of the Christian
era, when apostasy came in like a flood, men, without any warrant
or command of Scripture, thinking to do honor to Christ and despite
to the Jews who crucified Christ, began to neglect the Sabbath of the
fourth commandment, and to honor the day of the week on which Christ
rose from the dead, the first day, as <q>the Lord's day,</q> until finally the
Sabbath was almost wholly lost sight of, and the Sunday quite generally
took its place. But there was no more warrant for this change in the divine
and unchangeable law of God than there was for other errors and changes
which crept into the professed Christian church during this same time, such
as abstaining from meat on Friday in honor of the crucifixion; Mariolatry,
or the worship of the Virgin Mary; the mass; purgatory; indulgences;
prayers for the dead; saint-worship; and the human vicarship of Christ.
There was no more divine authority for one than for the others. All came
in through apostasy. The Bible knows but one true and living God, one
Lawgiver, one Mediator between God and man, one Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, one body, one Spirit, one hope, one faith, one baptism, and
<emph>one Sabbath</emph>. See Jer. 10:10-12; Rev. 14:6, 7; 1 Tim. 2:5; Eph. 4:4-6;
Ex. 20:8-11.

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Israel's
Babylonish captivity, under Nebuchadnezzar and
his sons, was seventy years long because that for 420 years, or for six times
seventy years,&mdash;from the days of Solomon to Nebuchadnezzar's time,&mdash;they
had largely neglected to keep the Sabbath. See Eze. 22:8, 26; Jer.
25:8-11; 17:24, 27; 2 Chron. 36:15-21. The seventy years' desolation
made up for the 420 years of Sabbath desecration. So during the millennium,
or the one thousand years after Christ's second advent, the whole
earth will lie desolate, or keep sabbath, for one thousand years, because
that for six thousand years the world's inhabitants have disregarded the
Sabbath. See this period and condition pointed out in Rev. 20:1-4; Isa.
24:1-6; Jer. 4:23-27. The periods of rest and desolation of the land are
divinely appointed sabbatical compensations for man's irreligion, as manifested
in Sabbath desecration. They are impressive lessons on the importance
of keeping the seventh-day Sabbath, and the results of breaking
and disregarding it.

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Through
want of sufficient light and investigation, and because
of the efforts of some who opposed the Sabbath during the Reformation,
Sunday was brought from Catholicism into the Protestant church, and
is now cherished as an institution of the Lord. It is clear, however, that it
is none of His planting, but rather the work and result of apostasy. But
a message is now going forth to revive the truth on this point, and calling
for a genuine reformation upon it. See pages <ref target='Pg251'>251-263</ref>,

1. What kind of worship does Christ say results from doctrines
based on the commandments of men?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>But in vain they do worship Me</hi>, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men.</q> Matt. 15:9.
</p>

<p>
2. What commandment did Christ say the Pharisees had
made void by their teaching?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>God commanded, saying, Honor thy father and mother</hi>.... But
ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his
mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by
me; and honor not his father or his mother, he shall be free.</q>
Verses 4-6.
</p>

<p>
3. What was the result of their course?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thus have ye <hi rend='italic'>made the commandment of God of none effect</hi>
by your tradition.</q> Verse 6.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;By a
gift or dedication of property to the temple service,
they taught that a man might be freed from the duties enjoined by the fifth
commandment.

4. What question did the disciples soon afterward ask Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Knowest Thou that the Pharisees were offended</hi>, after they
heard this saying?</q> Verse 12.
</p>

<p>
5. What answer did the Saviour make?
</p>

<p>
<q>But He answered and said, <hi rend='italic'>Every plant, which My Heavenly
Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up</hi>.</q> Verse 13.
</p>

<pb n='464'/><anchor id='Pg464'/>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;What is true
of the fifth commandment is true of every other
commandment. If through tradition men set aside any other of God's
commandments, the words of Christ to the Pharisees are equally applicable
to them. They are guilty of making void the commandment of God, and
of instituting vain worship.

</p>

<p>
9. When God's salvation is <hi rend='italic'>near to come</hi>, upon whom does
He pronounce a blessing?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do justice:

<p>
15. What have they done to maintain their theories?
</p>

<p>
<q>And her prophets have <hi rend='italic'>daubed them with untempered mortar</hi>,
<pb n='466'/><anchor id='Pg466'/>
seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, <hi rend='italic'>Thus
saith the Lord God, when the Lord hath not spoken</hi>.</q> Verse 28.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;Untempered mortar
is that which is improperly worked,
and will not therefore hold together or stand the test. Thus it is with the
reasons advanced for keeping Sunday instead of the Bible Sabbath, the
seventh day. They are not only unsound and untenable in themselves,
but are utterly inconsistent, contradictory, and destructive one of the
other, among themselves. They are like the witnesses employed by the
Jewish leaders to condemn Christ. Of these the record says: <q>The chief
priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put Him to
death; and found none. For many bare <emph>false witness</emph> against Him, but
<emph>their witness agreed not together</emph>.</q> Mark 14:55, 56. The lack of
<emph>agreement</emph> among them was evidence in itself of the
<emph>falsity</emph> of their testimony.
In nothing, perhaps, is a lack of agreement better illustrated than in the
reasons assigned for Sunday-keeping. Note the following:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
One says the Sabbath has been <emph>changed</emph> from the seventh to the first
day of the week.
</p>

<p>
Another says that the Sabbath commandment requires only one day
of rest after six of labor, and hence <emph>there has been no change</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Some reason that all ought to keep Sunday, because although, as they
affirm, God did not appoint a <emph>particular</emph> day, yet <emph>agreement</emph>
is necessary; and to have any or every day a sabbath would be equal to no sabbath at all.
</p>

<p>
Others, to avoid the claims of God's law, assert that the Sabbath
precept is one of those ordinances which was <emph>against us, contrary to us,
blotted out, and nailed to the cross</emph>. Still, they admit that a day of rest and
convocation is necessary, and therefore the day of Christ's resurrection,
they say, has been chosen.
</p>

<p>
Another class say they believe it is impossible to know which is the
<emph>seventh day</emph>, although they have no difficulty in ascertaining which is the
<emph>first</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Some are so bold even as to declare that <emph>Sunday is the original seventh
day</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Others, with equal certainty, say that those who keep the seventh
day are endeavoring to be <emph>justified by the law</emph>, and are
<emph>fallen from grace</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Another class, with more liberal views, say they believe that every one
should be fully persuaded in his own mind, whether he keep this day, or
that, or none at all.
</p>

<p>
Still again, as if having found the great desideratum or missing link
in the argument, men credited with even more than ordinary intelligence,
will sometimes declare that it is <emph>impossible to keep the seventh day on a round
and rolling earth</emph>; and yet, strange to say, they find no difficulty in keeping
<emph>Sunday anywhere</emph>, and believe that this day
should be observed <emph>the world
over</emph>!
</p>

<p>
Lastly, and more terrible and presumptuous than all the rest, some,
like Herod of old in slaying all the children of Bethlehem in order to make
sure of killing Christ, have gone so far as to teach that <emph>all ten commandments
have been abolished</emph>, in order to avoid the duty enjoined in the
<emph>fourth</emph>. But as in the case of Herod, God's Anointed escaped the murderous
blow of this wicked king, so in the judgment such will have to meet God over
His broken law, and will find that the Sabbath precept stands there unchanged
with the rest.
</p>

<p>
Said Christ, <q>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,
and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom
of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be
called great in the kingdom of heaven.</q> Matt. 5:19.

<q>Say unto them which daub it with untempered mortar,

<hi rend='italic'>O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend
it</hi>.</q>

<p>
18. Under which of the seven last plagues will this hail fall?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>the seventh angel</hi> poured out his vial into the air;
... and the cities of the nations fell: ... and every
island fled away, and the mountains were not found. And there
fell upon men <hi rend='italic'>a great hail</hi> out of heaven, every stone about the
weight of a talent.</q> Rev. 16:17-21.
</p>

<p>
19. In order to prepare His people for that terrible time,
what does God expect His ministers to do?
</p>

<p>
<q>Ye have not <hi rend='italic'>gone up into the gaps</hi>,
neither <hi rend='italic'>made up the hedge</hi>
for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the
Lord.</q> Eze. 13:5.
</p>

<p>
20. Instead of trying to close up this breach made in God's
law [the loss of the Sabbath], and so make up the hedge, what
have they done?
</p>

<p>
<q>They have seen vanity and lying divination, <hi rend='italic'>saying, The
Lord saith: and the Lord hath not sent them</hi>: and they have made
others to hope that they would confirm the word.</q> Verse 6.
</p>

<p>
21. During these closing scenes, what message is God sending
to the world to turn men from false worship to the worship
of the true and living God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment
is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth,
and the sea, and the fountains of waters.... Babylon is
fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations
drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.... If
any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark
in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine
of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into
the cup of His indignation.</q> Rev. 14:7-10.
</p>

<pb n='468'/><anchor id='Pg468'/>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This is
the last gospel message to be sent to the world before
the Lord comes. Under it will be developed two classes of people, one
having the mark of the beast (the Papacy), and the other keeping the commandments
of God, and having His seal, the Sabbath of the fourth commandment.

22. What, besides attending and taking part in religious

</p>

<p>
<q>Who <hi rend='italic'>went about doing good</hi>.</q> Acts 10:38. See Matt.
8:14-17; 12:1-15; Mark 2:23-28; 3:1-6; Luke 6:1-11; 13:11-17;
14:1-6; John 5:1-18; 9:1-41.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;When we come
to study the life of Christ, we find that He
did not make the Sabbath a day of idleness, nor even a day confined
wholly to public and private worship, but one of active service in blessing
others. On this day especially He went about doing good, ministering to
the sick, and bringing relief to those long bound by Satan. Luke 13:15,
16; John 5:5, 6. And as He is our pattern in all things, we, too, like
Him, should seek to make the Sabbath a day for helping and blessing
others. To loose the bands of wickedness, undo the heavy burdens, deal
bread to the hungry, clothe the naked, and let the oppressed go free, is
the fast which God has chosen, and the Sabbath-keeping most acceptable
to Him. Isa. 58:1-12. In this kind of work and ministry there is
room for a world-wide Sabbath reform.

<p>
<q>Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is

the Egyptians oppress them. Come now therefore, and I will

</p>

<p>
5. What provision did God make against slavery and oppression
in Israel?
</p>

<p>
<q>And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman,
<pb n='472'/><anchor id='Pg472'/>
be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then <hi rend='italic'>in the seventh
year thou shall let him go free</hi> from thee. And when thou sendest
him out free from thee, <hi rend='italic'>thou shall not let him go away empty</hi>: thou
shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor,
and out of thy wine-press: of that wherewith the Lord thy God
hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him. And <hi rend='italic'>thou shalt remember
that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt</hi>, and the
Lord thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this
thing today.</q> Deut. 15:12-15. <q><hi rend='italic'>Thou shalt neither vex a
stranger, nor oppress him</hi>: for ye were strangers in the land of
Egypt.</q> Ex. 22:21. See 2 Cor. 1:3, 4.
</p>

<p>
6. What was one reason assigned why Israel should keep the
Sabbath?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt</hi>,
and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a
mighty hand and by a stretched-out arm: <hi rend='italic'>therefore the Lord thy
God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day</hi>.</q> Deut. 5:15.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This would
suggest the idea that in their servitude and oppression
in Egypt they had had difficulty regarding the observance of the
Sabbath, which is a fact. From the accusation brought against Moses
and Aaron by Pharaoh, as recorded in Ex. 5:5,&mdash;<q>Ye make them <emph>rest</emph>
[Heb., <foreign lang='he' rend='italic'>Shabbath</foreign>]
from their burdens,</q>&mdash;it is plain that the Sabbath had
been denied them, that they had been required to work on the Sabbath,
and that Moses and Aaron were teaching them to keep it. Where individual
rights and religious liberty are recognized, Sabbath observance
is neither denied nor required by civil law.

7. What proclamation was to be made throughout the land

<hi rend='italic'>smite with the fist of wickedness</hi>.</q> Isa. 58:3, 4.
</p>

<p>
10. What does God set forth as the acceptable fast to Him?
</p>

<p>
<q>Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to <hi rend='italic'>loose the bands
of wickedness</hi>, to <hi rend='italic'>undo the
heavy burdens</hi>, and to <hi rend='italic'>let the oppressed
go free</hi>, and that ye <hi rend='italic'>break every
yoke</hi>? Is it not to <hi rend='italic'>deal thy bread
to the hungry</hi>, and that thou <hi rend='italic'>bring
the poor that are cast out to thy
house</hi>? when thou seest the naked, that thou
<hi rend='italic'>cover him</hi>; and that
thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?</q> Verses 6, 7.

<p>
11. What was Christ's mission to this world?
</p>

<p>
<q>The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath
anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He hath sent
Me <hi rend='italic'>to heal</hi> the broken-hearted,
<hi rend='italic'>to preach deliverance</hi> to the captives,
and recovering of sight to the blind, <hi rend='italic'>to set at liberty</hi> them
that are bruised.</q> Luke 4:18.
</p>

show that a large part of Christ's time even
on the Sabbath was devoted to relieving the oppressed and distressed.

<p>
12. In what condition are those who commit sin?
</p>

<p>
<q>Whosoever committeth sin is <hi rend='italic'>the servant of sin</hi>.</q> John
8:34.
</p>

<p>
13. Why was Christ's name to be called Jesus?
</p>

<p>
<q>And thou shalt call His name Jesus: <hi rend='italic'>for He shall save His
people from their sins</hi>.</q> Matt. 1:21.
</p>

<p>
14. What lies at the root of all sin?
</p>

<p>
<q>When <hi rend='italic'>lust</hi> hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin.</q> James
1:15. <q>I had not known <hi rend='italic'>lust</hi>, except the law had said, Thou
shalt not <hi rend='italic'>covet</hi>.</q> Rom. 7:7.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Lust, covetousness,
and unlawful desire are only different
names for <emph>selfishness</emph>. Selfishness lies at the root of all sin; and
selfishness is simply the love of self to the disregard of the equal rights of others.
</quote>

<p>
15. By what scripture is the equality of rights clearly shown?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou shalt love thy neighbor <hi rend='italic'>as thyself</hi>.</q> Lev. 19:18.
</p>

<p>
16. What rule of conduct has Christ laid down in harmony
with this command?
</p>

<p>
<q>Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye
even so to them.</q> Matt. 7:12.
</p>

<q>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must
be saved.</q> Acts 4:12. See also 1 John 1:9.

<p>
19. What was Christ's attitude toward unbelievers?
</p>

<p>
<q>If any man hear My words, and believe not, <hi rend='italic'>I judge him
not</hi>: for I came not to <hi rend='italic'>judge</hi>
the world, but to <hi rend='italic'>save</hi> the world.</q>
John 12:47.
</p>

<p>
20. What spirit did Christ say should control His disciples?
</p>

<p>
<q>But Jesus called them to Him, and saith unto them, Ye
know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles
exercise <hi rend='italic'>lordship</hi> over them; and their great ones exercise
<hi rend='italic'>authority</hi> upon them. But
<hi rend='italic'>so shall it not be among you</hi>: but
whosoever will be great among you, shall be your <hi rend='italic'>minister</hi>: and
whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be <hi rend='italic'>servant of all</hi>.
For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.</q> Mark 10:42-45.

<p>
21. What is present where the Spirit of the Lord is?

22. What kind of worship only is acceptable to God?
</p>

<p>
<q>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipers
shall worship the Father <hi rend='italic'>in spirit and in truth</hi>: for the Father

1. Who should be subject to civil government?
</p>

<p>
<q>Let <hi rend='italic'>every soul</hi> be subject unto the higher powers. For
there is no power but of God.</q> Rom. 13:1.
</p>

<p>
2. By whom are the powers that be ordained?
</p>

<p>
<q>The powers that be are ordained of <hi rend='italic'>God</hi>.</q> Same verse.
</p>

<p>
3. What does one resist, who resists civil authority?
</p>

<p>
<q>Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth <hi rend='italic'>the
ordinance of God</hi>: and they that resist shall receive to themselves
damnation.</q> Verse 2.

<p>
4. What do the Scriptures indicate as the proper sphere and
legitimate work of civil authority?
</p>

<p>
<q>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the <hi rend='italic'>evil</hi>....
If thou do that which is <hi rend='italic'>evil</hi>, be afraid; for he beareth
not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, <hi rend='italic'>a revenger
to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil</hi>.</q> Verses 3, 4.
</p>

<p>
5. For whom is law made?
</p>

<p>
<q>Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous
man, but <hi rend='italic'>for the lawless and disobedient</hi>.</q> 1 Tim. 1:9.
</p>

<pb n='476'/><anchor id='Pg476'/>

<p>
6. How are Christians admonished to respect civil authority?
</p>

<p>
<q>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and
powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work.</q>
Titus 3:1. <q>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for
the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; or unto
governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment
of evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well....
Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor
the king.</q> 1 Peter 2: 13-17. <q>For this cause pay ye tribute
also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon
this very thing. Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to
whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom
fear; honor to whom honor.</q> Rom. 13:6, 7.
</p>

<p>
7. In what words does Christ show that there is another
realm outside of Cæsar's, or civil government?
</p>

<p>
<q>Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's;
<hi rend='italic'>and unto God the things that are God's</hi>.</q> Matt. 22:21.
</p>

<p>
8. To whom alone did He say worship is to be rendered?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou shalt worship <hi rend='italic'>the Lord
thy God</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>Him only shalt
thou serve</hi>.</q> Matt. 4:10.
</p>

<p>
9. What decree did King Nebuchadnezzar once make respecting
worship?
</p>

<p>
<q>To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,
that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp,
sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye <hi rend='italic'>fall down
and worship the golden image</hi> that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath
set up. And whoso falleth not down and worshipeth shall the
same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</q>
Dan. 3:4-6.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This decree
was in direct conflict with the second commandment
of God's law, which forbids making, bowing down to, and serving
images. It was religious, idolatrous, and persecuting in character.
</quote>

<p>
10. What answer did the three Hebrew captives, Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed-nego, return when asked by the king why
they had not fallen down and worshiped the golden image, as
he had commanded?
</p>

<p>
<q>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to
the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee
in this matter. If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to
deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver
us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee,
<pb n='477'/><anchor id='Pg477'/>
O king, that <hi rend='italic'>we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden
image which thou hast set up</hi>.</q> Verses 16-18.
</p>

<p>
11. What did Nebuchadnezzar then do?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of
his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego:
... and he commanded the most mighty men that
were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,
and to <hi rend='italic'>cast them into the burning fiery furnace</hi>.</q> Verses 19, 20.
</p>

<p>
12. After their miraculous deliverance, what did Nebuchadnezzar
say?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God
of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent His
angel, and delivered His servants that trusted in Him, and have
changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they
might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</q>
Verse 28.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;By preserving
these men in the fire, and thus changing the
king's word, God was demonstrating before all the world, through this greatest
of then-existing earthly kingdoms, that with the question of religion civil
governments can of right have nothing whatsoever to do; that religion is a
realm outside the legitimate sphere of civil authority; and that every individual
should be left free to worship, or not to worship, according to the
dictates of his own conscience. The lesson to be learned from this is that,
although ordained of God, civil governments are not ordained to direct
or oppress men in religious matters.

<p>
13. How only did the envious princes and rulers under King
Darius conclude that they could effect the downfall of Daniel?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against
this Daniel, except we find it against him <hi rend='italic'>concerning the law of
his God</hi>.</q> Dan. 6:5.
</p>

<p>
14. To this end, what decree did they prevail upon the king
to make and sign?
</p>

<p>
<q>That whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man
for thirty days, <hi rend='italic'>save of thee, O king</hi>, he shall be cast into the
den of lions.</q> Verse 7.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Unlike
the decree of Nebuchadnezzar, this decree forbade
the worship of the true God, and was therefore in direct conflict with the
first commandment, which forbids the worship of any other than the true
God. Like it, however, it was religious and persecuting in character.
</quote>

<p>
15. How did Daniel regard this decree?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he
went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber
toward Jerusalem, <hi rend='italic'>he kneeled upon his knees three times a day,
<pb n='479'/><anchor id='Pg479'/>
and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime</hi>.</q>

16. What was finally done with Daniel?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and
<hi rend='italic'>cast him into the den of lions</hi>.</q> Verse 16.
</p>

<p>
17. What did Darius say to Daniel the next morning when
he came to the lions' den?
</p>

<p>
<q>The king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of
the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually,
able to deliver thee from the lions?</q> Verse 20.
</p>

<p>
18. What was Daniel's reply?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live forever. My
God hath sent His angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that
they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before Him innocency
was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no
hurt.</q> Verses 21, 22.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Here again
was demonstrated by a most remarkable miracle,
wrought in the face of the greatest nation then in existence, that with
the directing, prescribing, proscribing, or interfering with religion or its
free exercise, civil governments can of right have nothing whatever to do;
that religion is an individual matter, and should be left to the dictates of
each one's own conscience.
</quote>

<p>
19. Before leaving His disciples, what command did Christ
give them?
</p>

<p>
<q>Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every

</p>

<p>
20. What counter-command did the Jewish Sanhedrin soon
afterward give them?
</p>

<p>
<q>And they called them, and commanded them not to speak
at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</q> Acts 4:18.
</p>

<p>
21. What reply did Peter and John make?
</p>

<p>
<q>But Peter and John answered and said unto them, <hi rend='italic'>Whether
it be right in the sight of God to harken unto you more than unto
God, judge ye</hi>. For we cannot but speak the things which we
have seen and heard.</q> Verses 19, 20.
</p>

<p>
22. For continuing to preach Jesus, what did the Jewish
rulers do to the apostles?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with
him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with
indignation, and <hi rend='italic'>laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in
the common prison</hi>.</q> Acts 5:17, 18.
</p>

<pb n='480'/><anchor id='Pg480'/>

23. What did an angel of God then do?

<q>But the angel of the Lord by night <hi rend='italic'>opened the prison doors,
and brought them forth</hi>, and said, <hi rend='italic'>Go, stand and speak in the
temple to the people all the words of this life</hi>.</q> Verses 19, 20.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Here
once again is demonstrated the fact that men have
no right to interfere with the free exercise of religion, and that when the
laws of men conflict with the law and Word of God, we are to obey the
latter, whatever the consequences may be. God Himself has set the seal
of His approval to such a course. John Bunyan was imprisoned for
twelve years for daring to preach the gospel contrary to law.

25. What reply did the apostles make?

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;<q>Obedience

favor of the authority of civil law, and any refusal to obey must be based
on the moral proof that obedience will be sin.... It is still true that
obedience to human law often involves sin against God and man. There
are cases so clear that no one can question the duty to refuse obedience.
In all times and in all lands such cases have arisen.</q> <q>It is too obvious

</p>

<p>
God has placed the sword (civil authority) in the hands of Cæsar
(civil government) for the punishment of evil-doers; but when the sword
is raised to slay the <emph>innocent</emph>, as in the case of the children of Bethlehem
(Matt. 2:16); or to <emph>enforce idolatrous worship</emph>, as in the case of the three
Hebrews (Daniel 3); or to <emph>prohibit the worship of the true God</emph>, as in the
case of Daniel (Daniel 6); or to slay <emph>all of God's people</emph>, as in the time of
Esther; or to <emph>enforce the observance of a false sabbath</emph>, as in the case of
all Sunday laws, it is an <emph>abuse</emph> of civil authority, and not a proper or
justifiable use of it; and God honors those who, under such circumstances, in the face of
persecution, oppression, and death, remain loyal and true to Him.
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>Government is never the gainer in the execution of a law that is
manifestly unjust.... Conscientious men are not the enemies, but
the friends, of any government but a tyranny. They are its strength,
and not its weakness. Daniel, in Babylon, praying contrary to the law,
was the true friend and supporter of the government; while those who, in
their pretended zeal for the law and the constitution, would strike down
the good man, were its real enemies. It is only when government transcends
its sphere that it comes in conflict with the consciences of men.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend='pre'>But it is objected that the example is corrupting,&mdash;that a bad man
will violate a good law, because the good man refuses to obey a wicked
law. The cases are just as unlike as right and wrong, and any attempt to
justify the one by the other is gross dishonesty. Unquestionably, the
principle can be abused by the wicked, and so can any truth whatever;
but the principle of unquestioning obedience to human law is false, and
needs no perversion to make it mischievous....</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It should always be remembered that the great end of government
is human well-being, that law and authority are nothing in themselves,
and that all their sacredness arises from the uses which they serve. The
machinery of government is valuable only for the work it does; in itself,
it has no value.... The most grievous of all imperfections in government
is the failure to secure the just and good result.... Injustice
and oppression are not made tolerable by being in strict accordance
with the law. Nothing is surer, in the end, than the reaction of such
wrong to break down the most perfectly constituted
government.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>Moral
Philosophy,</q> by James H. Fairchild, pages 184-186.</hi>
</p>

<p>
God is above all earthly rulers, and His law above all human laws.
He made us, and we therefore owe allegiance to Him before any earthly
power, potentate, or tribunal. And this is saying nothing in disparagement
of civil authority exercised in its rightful domain&mdash;civil things.

1. What is religion?
</p>

<p>
<q>The recognition of God as an object of worship, love, and
obedience.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Webster.</hi> Other definitions equally good are:
<q>The duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of
discharging it.</q> <q>Man's personal relation of faith and obedience
to God.</q>
</p>

<p>
2. In religious things, whom alone did Christ say we should
recognize as Father?
</p>

<p>
<q>And call no man your father upon the earth: <hi rend='italic'>for one is your
Father, which is in heaven</hi>.</q> Matt. 23:9.
</p>

<p>
3. When tempted to fall down and worship Satan, what
Scripture command did Christ cite in justification of His refusal
to do this?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it
is written, <hi rend='italic'>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only
shalt thou serve</hi>.</q> Matt. 4:10. See Deut. 6:13; 10:20.
</p>

<p>
4. To whom alone, then, is each one accountable in religious
things?
</p>

<p>
<q>So then every one of us shall give account of himself <hi rend='italic'>to
God</hi>.</q> Rom. 14:12.

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;With this
agree the words of Washington: <q>Every man who
conducts himself as a good citizen, is accountable alone to God for his
religious faith, and should be protected in worshiping God according to
the dictates of his own conscience.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Reply
to Virginia Baptists, in 1789.</hi>
</quote>

<p>
5. What do those do, therefore, who make men accountable
to them in religious affairs?
</p>

<p>
They put themselves in the place of God. See 2 Thess.
2:3, 4.
</p>

<p>
6. Why, in religious matters, did Christ say men should
not be called masters?
</p>

<p>
<q>Neither be ye called masters: <hi rend='italic'>for one is your Master, even
Christ</hi>.</q> Matt. 23:10.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Every one,
therefore, who acts as master in Christ's church,
or lords it over God's heritage (1 Peter 5:3), puts himself in the place
of Christ.

<p>
7. To whom, then, as servants, are we responsible in matters
of faith and worship?
</p>

<p>
<q>Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? <hi rend='italic'>to his
own master he standeth or falleth</hi>.</q> Rom. 14:4.
</p>

<p>
8. Whose servants are we not to be?
</p>

<p>
<q>Ye are bought with a price; <hi rend='italic'>be not ye the servants of men</hi>.</q>
1 Cor. 7:23.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;<q>Satan's
methods ever tend to one end,&mdash;to make men the
slaves of men,</q> and thus separate them from God, destroy faith in God,
and so expose men to temptation and sin. Christ's work is to set men
free, to renew faith, and to lead to willing and loyal obedience to God.
Says Luther: <q>It is contrary to the will of God that man should be subject
to man in that which pertains to eternal life. Subjection in <emph>spirituals</emph>
is a real worship, and should be rendered only to the
Creator.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>D'Aubigne's

9. Where must all finally appear to render up their account?
</p>

<p>
<q>For we must all appear <hi rend='italic'>before the judgment-seat of Christ</hi>;
that every one may receive the things done in his body, according
to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</q> 2
Cor. 5:10.

should be no human constraint nor compulsion in religious affairs.

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>the mystery of iniquity</hi> doth already work.</q> 2 Thess.
2:7.
</p>

2. What class of men did he say would arise in the church?

<q>For I know this, that after my departing shall <hi rend='italic'>grievous

<p>
4. In what was shown the first tangible evidence of this
<q>falling away</q> from the truth of God?
</p>

<p>
The adoption of heathen rites and customs in the church.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

the Christian worship, by way of accommodation to the infirmities and

prejudices, both of Jews and heathen, in order to facilitate their conversion
to Christianity.... For this purpose, they gave the name of <emph>mysteries</emph>
to the institutions of the gospel, and decorated particularly the holy
sacrament with that solemn title. They used in that sacred institution,
as also in that of baptism, several of the terms employed in the heathen
mysteries, and proceeded so far, at length, as even to adopt some of the

</p>

<p>
<q>This imitation began in the eastern provinces; but, after
the time of Adrian [emperor 117-138 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>], who first introduced
the mysteries among the Latins, it was followed by the
Christians who dwelt in the western parts of the

<p>
6. What has been one great characteristic of the Papacy?
</p>

<p>
A union of church and state, or the religious power dominating
the civil power to further its ends.
</p>

<p>
7. When was the union of church and state formed from
which the Papacy grew?
</p>

<p>
During the reign of Constantine, 313-337 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>
</p>

<p>
8. What was the character and the work of many of the
bishops at that time?
</p>

<p>
<q><emph>Worldly-minded bishops</emph>, instead of caring for the salvation
of their flocks, were often but too much inclined to travel about,

concerns</emph>.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Neander's <q>History
of the Christian Religion and Church</q></hi> (Torrey's translation),

</p>

<p>
9. What did the bishops determine to do?
</p>

<p>
<q>This theocratical theory was already the prevailing one
in the time of Constantine; and ... the bishops voluntarily
made themselves dependent on him by their disputes,
<hi rend='italic'>and by their determination to make use of the power of the state for
the furtherance of their aims</hi>.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Id.</hi>, page 132.
</p>

<p>
11. When and by whom was the Council of Nice convened?
</p>

<p>
By the emperor Constantine, 325 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi>
</p>

<p>
12. Under what authority were its decrees published?
</p>

<pb n='486'/><anchor id='Pg486'/>

<p>
<q>The decrees ... were published under the <hi rend='italic'>imperial
authority</hi>, and thus obtained a political
importance.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Id.</hi>,
page 133.
</p>

<p>
13. What was one principal object in calling this council?
</p>

<p>
<q>The question relating to <hi rend='italic'>the observance of Easter</hi>, which
was agitated in the time of Anicetus and Polycarp, and afterward
in that of Victor, was still undecided. It was one of the
principal reasons for convoking the Council of Nice, being the
most important subject to be considered after the Arian controversy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It appears that the churches of Syria and Mesopotamia
continued to follow the custom of the Jews, and celebrated
Easter on <emph>the fourteenth day of the moon</emph>, whether falling on Sunday
or not. All the other churches observed that solemnity
<emph>on Sunday only</emph>, namely; those of Rome, Italy, Africa, Lydia,
Egypt, Spain, Gaul, and Britain; and all Greece, Asia, and
Pontus.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Boyle's <q>Historical View of the Council of
Nice,</q></hi>

the full moon which was nearest after the vernal
equinox.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Id.</hi>, page 24.

<p>
15. What was decreed by the Council of Laodicea, <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> 364?
</p>

<p>
That Christians should keep the Sunday, and that if they
persisted in resting on the Sabbath, <q>they shall be shut out
from Christ.</q> See Hefele's <q>History of the Councils of the
Church,</q> Vol. II, page 316.

<p>
16. What imperial law was issued in <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> 386?
</p>

<p>
<q>By a law of the year 386, those older changes effected by
Constantine were more vigorously enforced; and, in general,
civil transactions of every kind on Sunday were strictly
forbidden.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Neander's

</p>

<p>
17. What petition was made to the emperor by a church
convention of bishops in <hi rend='smallcaps'>a.d.</hi> 401?
</p>

<p>
<q>That the public shows might be transferred from the
Christian Sunday and from the feast-days to some other days
of the week.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi>

</quote>

<p>
18. What was the object of the church bishops in securing
these Sunday laws?
</p>

<p>
<q>That the day might be devoted with less interruption to
<pb n='487'/><anchor id='Pg487'/>
the purposes of devotion.</q> <q>That the devotion of the faithful
might be free from all disturbance.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Id.</hi>, pages 297, 301.
</p>

<p>
19. How was the <q>devotion</q> of the <q>faithful</q> disturbed?
</p>

<p>
<q>Church teachers ... were, in truth, often forced to
complain that <emph>in such competitions the theater was vastly more
frequented than the church</emph>.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Id.</hi>, page 300.
</p>

<p>
20. What does Neander say of the securing of these laws?
</p>

<p>
<q>In this way the church received help from the state for
the furtherance of her ends.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Id.</hi>, page 301.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In
this way, more perhaps than in any other, church and
state were united. In this way the church gained control of the civil power,
which she later used as a means of carrying on most bitter and extensive
persecutions. In this way she denied Christ and the power of godliness.
</quote>

<p>
21. When the church had received help from the state to
this extent, what more did she demand?
</p>

<p>
That the civil power should be exerted to compel men to
serve God as the church should dictate.
</p>

<p>
22. What did Augustine, the father of this theocratical or
church-and-state theory, teach concerning it?
</p>

<p>
<q>Who doubts but what it is better to be led to God by instruction
than by fear of punishment or affliction? But because
the former, who will be guided only by instruction, are
better, the others are still not to be neglected.... Many,
like bad servants, must often be reclaimed to their Master by
the rod of temporal suffering, ere they can attain to this highest
stage of religious development.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Id.</hi>, pages 214, 215.
</p>

<p>
23. What is Neander's conclusion regarding this theory?
</p>

<p>
<q>It was by Augustine, then, that a theory was proposed
and founded, which, tempered though it was, in its practical
application, by his own pious, philanthropic spirit, nevertheless
contained the germ of that whole system of spiritual despotism,
of intolerance and persecution, which ended in the tribunals
of the Inquisition.</q> <q>He did not give precedence to the question,
What is <emph>right</emph>? over the question, What is <emph>expedient</emph>? But
a theory which overlooks these distinctions leaves room for
any despotism which would make holy ends a pretext for the
use of unholy means.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Id.</hi>, pages 217, 249, 250.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;It
was thus that the union of church and state was formed,
out of which was developed <q>the beast,</q> or Papacy, of the Apocalypse,
which made <q>war with the saints</q> and overcame them. A like course
cannot fail to produce like results today. Dr. Philip Schaff, in his work
on <q>Church and State,</q> page 11, well says: <q>Secular power has proved a
satanic gift to the church, and ecclesiastical power has proved an engine
of tyranny in the hands of the state.</q>

<q>Let all the judges and town people, and the occupation

1. Because Jesus had not kept the Sabbath according to
their ideas, what did the Jews do?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay
Him</hi>, because He had done these things on the Sabbath day.</q>
John 5:16.
</p>

<p>
2. What kind of fast is most acceptable to God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Is not this the fast that I have chosen? <hi rend='italic'>to loose the bands
of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed
go free, and that ye break every yoke?</hi></q> Isa. 58:6.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This is
what Jesus did. He, the Author and Lord of the
Sabbath, in addition to attending and taking part in religious services
(Luke 4:16), went about doing good, healing the sick, relieving the oppressed,
and restoring the impotent, lame, and blind, on the Sabbath day.
But this, while in perfect accord with the law of God, the great law of love,
was contrary to the traditions and perverted ideas of the Jews respecting
the Sabbath. Hence they persecuted Him, and sought to slay Him.

3. Why did Cain kill Abel?
</p>

<p>
<q>For this is the message that ye have heard from the beginning,
that we should love one another. Not as Cain, who was
of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew
<pb n='493'/><anchor id='Pg493'/>
he him? <hi rend='italic'>Because his own works were evil, and his brother's
righteous.</hi></q> 1 John 3:11, 12.

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The following
comment upon this passage by M. de Chesnais,
a Catholic priest of New Zealand, is well put: <q>If you would read the
Word of God, you would find that from the beginning all good people were
persecuted because they were good. Abel was slain by his brother because
he was good, and Cain could not endure the sight of
him.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Kaikoura

4. Commenting upon the treatment of Isaac, the son of
Sarah, by Ishmael, the son of the bondwoman, what principle
does the apostle Paul lay down?
</p>

<p>
<q>But as then, <hi rend='italic'>he that was born after the flesh persecuted him
that was born after the Spirit</hi>, even so it is now.</q> Gal. 4:29.

<p>
5. What other instances of persecution mentioned in the
Bible, demonstrate the correctness of this principle?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>a.</hi> Esau, who sold his birthright, persecuted Jacob, who

God. Acts 8:1; 9:1, 2; 22:4, 5, 20; 26:9-11; Gal. 1:13;
1 Tim. 1:12, 13.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The history
of all the religious persecutions since Bible times
is but a repetition of this same story,&mdash;the wicked persecute the righteous.

6. Who does Paul say shall suffer persecution?
</p>

<q>Yea, and <hi rend='italic'>all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
persecution</hi>.</q> 2 Tim. 3:12.
</p>

<p>
7. What is essential to extensive religious persecution?
</p>

<p>
Ecclesiastical control of the civil power, or a union of church
and state.
</p>

<p>
8. Since persecution is invariably wrong, and the persecutor
is generally in the wrong on religious subjects, what must be
true of persecuting governments?
</p>

<p>
They likewise must be in the wrong.

<p>
God never forces the will or the conscience; but, in order to bring
men under sin, Satan resorts to force. To accomplish his purpose, he
works through religious and secular rulers, influencing them to enact and
enforce human laws in defiance of the law of God.

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;Some
of the reasons given in justification of persecution
may be noted in the following quotations:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>The state cannot afford to permit religious liberty. We hear a
great deal about religious tolerance, but we are only tolerant in so far as
we are not interested. A person may be tolerant toward a religion if he
is not religious.... Intolerance means fervor and zeal. The best
the state can do is to establish a limited religious liberty; but beyond a
certain degree of tolerance the state cannot afford to admit the
doctrine.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Monsignor
Russell (Catholic), quoted in Washington Post, May 5, 1910.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<q>The church has persecuted. Only a tyro in church history will
deny that.... We have always defended the persecution of the
Huguenots, and the Spanish Inquisition. When she thinks it good to use
physical force, she will use it.... But will the Catholic Church give
bond that she will not persecute at all? Will she guarantee absolute freedom
and equality of all churches and all faiths? The Catholic Church
gives no bonds for her good behavior.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Editorial
in Western Watchman
(Catholic), of St. Louis, Mo., Dec. 24, 1908.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<q>The Inquisition was a very merciful tribunal; I repeat it, almost a
compassionate tribunal.... A man was only allowed to be racked
once, which no one can deny was a most wonderful leniency in those
times.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Catholic Mirror, official
organ of Cardinal Gibbons, Aug. 29, 1896.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<q>We confess that the Roman Catholic Church is intolerant; that is
to say, that it uses all the means in its power for the extirpation of error
and sin; but this intolerance is the logical and necessary consequence of
her infallibility. <emph>She alone has the right to be intolerant, because she alone
has the truth.</emph> The church tolerates heretics where she is obliged to do so,
but she hates them mortally, and employs all her force to secure their
annihilation.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Shepherd of the Valley
(St. Louis, Mo.), 1876.</hi>
</p>

<p>
This erroneous position has been well refuted by Lord Macaulay
in the following words: <q>The doctrine which, from the very first origin
of religious dissensions, has been held by all bigots of all sects, when condensed
into few words and stripped of rhetorical disguise, is simply this:
I am in the right, and you are in the wrong. When you are the stronger,
you ought to tolerate me; for it is your duty to tolerate truth. But when
I am the stronger, I shall persecute you; for it is my duty to persecute
error.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Essay on <q>Sir James Mackintosh.</q></hi>
</p>

<p>
Benjamin Franklin well said: <q>When religion is good it will take care
of itself; when it is not able to take care of itself, and God does not see fit to
take care of it, so that it has to appeal to the civil power for support, it is
evidence to my mind that its cause is a bad one.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Letter
to Dr. Price.</hi>
</p>

<p>
John Wesley gave the following Christian advice: <q>Condemn no man
for not thinking as you think. Let every one enjoy the full and free liberty
of thinking for himself. Let every man use his own judgment, since every
man must give an account of himself to God. Abhor every approach, in
any kind or degree, to the spirit of persecution. If you cannot reason nor
persuade a man into the truth, never attempt to force a man into it. If
love will not compel him to come, leave him to God, the Judge of all.</q>

<q>Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared

<p>
<q>And the great <hi rend='italic'>dragon</hi> was
cast out, that old <hi rend='italic'>serpent</hi>, called
the Devil, and <hi rend='italic'>Satan</hi>, which deceiveth the whole world.</q> Rev.

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Thou wast perfect</hi> in thy ways from the day that thou wast
created, till iniquity was found in thee.</q> Eze. 28:15.

5. What description is given of him by the prophet Ezekiel?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thus saith the Lord God; <hi rend='italic'>Thou sealest up the sum, full of
wisdom, and perfect in beauty</hi>. Thou hast been in Eden the
garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, ... the
workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in
thee in the day that thou wast created. Thou art the anointed
cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon
the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in
the midst of the stones of fire.</q> Verses 12-14.
</p>

<pb n='500'/><anchor id='Pg500'/>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;From
this it is evident that Satan was a high and exalted
angel before he fell, a masterpiece of wisdom and beauty. From the reference
to his <q>tabrets</q> and <q>pipes</q> it seems probable that he was chorister
of heaven, and led the angelic host in song. In the earthly sanctuary
the cherubim overshadowed the mercy-seat. Ex. 25:16-22; Heb. 9:3-5;
Ps. 99:1.

6. What unholy, ambitious spirit took possession of Satan,

the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will
ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most
High.</q> Isa. 14:13, 14.
</p>

<p>
7. Did pride also contribute to his fall?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty</hi>, thou hast
corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy <hi rend='italic'>brightness</hi>.</q> Eze. 28:17.

</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Pride</hi> goeth before destruction,
and <hi rend='italic'>an haughty spirit</hi> before
a fall.</q> Prov. 16:18.
</p>

<p>
9. How does the prophet Isaiah describe Satan's fall?
</p>

<p>
<q>How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the
morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst
weaken the nations!</q> Isa. 14:12.
</p>

<p>
10. Why was Satan cast from his high position?
</p>

<p>
<q>By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the
midst of thee with violence, <hi rend='italic'>and thou hast sinned</hi>: therefore I
will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will
destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones
of fire.</q> Eze. 28:16.
</p>

<p>
11. When cast out of the mountain of God, to what place
were Satan and his angels banished, to be kept till the judgment?
</p>

<p>
<q>For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but <hi rend='italic'>cast
them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness</hi>,
to be reserved unto judgment.</q> 2 Peter 2:4.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This, we
understand, is the darkness surrounding this world,
and is symbolic of the darkness of utter hopelessness and despair in rebellion
and sin. When Satan led man to sin, darkness was brought upon
this world. But God did not leave man to hopelessness. In His mercy
and great love He caused <q>the light of the glorious gospel of Christ</q> to
shine, to call men <q>out of darkness into His marvelous light.</q> That Satan
and the angels who fell with him had a period of probation and opportunity
to repent, there can be no doubt. Their fate is the result of stubborn
rebellion and persistence in sin in spite of the overtures of mercy and the
<pb n='501'/><anchor id='Pg501'/>
offers of pardon. For this they were cast out of heaven. The wicked
angels are kept in everlasting chains of darkness.
</quote>

<p>
12. How is the conflict which took place in heaven between
Christ and Satan described by the revelator?
</p>

<p>
<q>And there was war in heaven: Michael and His angels
fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,
and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in
heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent,
called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world:
he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with
him.</q> Rev. 12:7-9.
</p>

<p>
13. In what terms did Christ refer to Satan's fall?
</p>

<p>
<q>And He said unto them, <hi rend='italic'>I beheld Satan as lightning fall
from heaven</hi>.</q> Luke 10:18.
</p>

<p>
14. Has Satan ever appeared before God since his fall?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
themselves before the Lord, <hi rend='italic'>and Satan came also among
them</hi>.</q> Job 1:6. See also chapter 2:1.
</p>

<p>
15. When asked whence he came, what was Satan's reply?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, <hi rend='italic'>From going to

1:7. See Job 2:2.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;By tempting man to sin, Satan usurped man's dominion
over the earth. Rom. 6:16; 2 Peter 2:19. This he now claims as his
kingdom (Luke 4:6); hence the temptation in offering the kingdoms of
this world to Christ. As the <q>god</q> and ruler of this world, Satan, for
four thousand years before the crucifixion of Christ, appeared before God
among the representatives of other worlds, as the representative of this
world. After accomplishing the death of Christ, the Son of God, the sinless
One, Satan was cast out of this council, or assembly, and has not been
permitted to enter it since. This was his second fall, and the one, doubtless,
to which Christ, just before His crucifixion, alluded when he said,
<q>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be
<emph>cast out</emph>.</q> John 12:31. His final fall and destruction are still future.

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This, as
far as the record shows, was <emph>the first lie</emph>,&mdash;a direct
denial of the word of God. By persuading Eve to accept and believe it,
Satan led our first parents to <emph>commit sin</emph>;
and, as <q>the wages of sin is <emph>death</emph>,</q>
by it, also, he caused their <emph>death</emph>, and so
became, in reality, <emph>the first murderer</emph>.
A lie, therefore, is a twin brother to murder, and one of the most hateful
things to God, the <q>God of <emph>truth</emph>.</q> See Prov. 6:16-19. <q>The lip of
truth shall be established forever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.</q>

1. In what condition was man created?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou madest him <hi rend='italic'>a little lower than the angels</hi>.</q> Ps. 8:5.
</p>

<p>
2. What will be the final condition of the righteous?

<q><hi rend='italic'>Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the

3. What are angels called?
</p>

<p>
<q>And of the angels He saith, Who maketh His angels <hi rend='italic'>spirits</hi>,

<q>The first man Adam was made <hi rend='italic'>a living soul</hi>; the last Adam

5. Are our present bodies natural or spiritual?

<q>Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that
which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</q>
Verse 46.
</p>

<p>
6. When will the righteous have spiritual bodies?

<p>
<q>It is sown a natural body; <hi rend='italic'>it is raised a spiritual body</hi>.
There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</q>

<quote rend='display'>

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;The living soul was not put <emph>into</emph> the
man; but the breath of <emph>life</emph> which was put into man, made
<emph>him</emph>&mdash;the man, made of the earth&mdash;a
<emph>living</emph> soul, or creature.
</p>

<p>
The original for <q>living soul</q> in this text is
<foreign lang='he' rend='italic'>nephesh chaiyah</foreign>. On the
use of this expression in Gen. 1:24, translated <q>living creature,</q> Dr. Adam
Clarke says: <q>A general term to express all creatures endued with animal
life, in any of its infinitely varied gradations, from the half-reasoning
elephant down to the stupid potto, or lower still, to the polyp, which
seems equally to share the vegetable and animal life.</q>
</p>
</quote>

<p>
12. Are other creatures besides man called <q>living souls</q>?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea;

died in the sea</hi>.</q> Rev. 16:3. See also Gen. 1:30, margin.

<p>
13. Do others besides man have the <q>breath of life</q>?

<p>
<q>And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of <hi rend='italic'>fowl</hi>,
and of <hi rend='italic'>cattle</hi>, and of <hi rend='italic'>beast</hi>,
and of <hi rend='italic'>every creeping thing</hi> that creepeth
upon the earth, and every man: <hi rend='italic'>all in whose nostrils was the
breath of life</hi>.</q> Gen. 7:21, 22.
</p>

<p>
14. Is their breath the same as man's?
</p>

<p>
<q>As the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, <hi rend='italic'>they have all one
breath</hi>; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for
all is vanity.</q> Eccl. 3:19.
</p>

<pb n='507'/><anchor id='Pg507'/>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;That
is, here men, as well as beasts, die. This present life,
with them, as with the rest of the animal creation, is dependent upon their
breath. When this is gone, they, the same as beasts, die. In this respect
they have no preeminence over beasts. But men have a future unending
life held out before them, and may, if they will, die in hope of eternal life,
which is a very great preeminence over the rest of the animal creation.

15. What does Job call that which God breathed into man's

<q>All the while my breath is in me, and <hi rend='italic'>the spirit of God is

<p>
<q>Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and
<hi rend='italic'>the spirit shall return unto God who gave it</hi>.</q> Eccl. 12:7.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;That is,
the spirit of life by which man lives, and which is
only lent him of God, at death goes back to the great Author of life. Having
come from Him, it belongs to God, and man can have it eternally only as a
gift from God, through Jesus Christ. Rom. 6:23. When the spirit goes
back to God, the dust, from which man was made a <q>living soul</q> in the
beginning, goes back <emph>as it was</emph>, to the earth, and the individual no longer
exists as a living, conscious, thinking being, except as he exists in the mind,
plan, and purpose of God through Christ and the resurrection. In this
sense <q>all live unto Him</q> (Luke 20:38), for all are to be raised from the
dead. See John 5:28, 29; Acts 24:15; Rom. 4:17.

tree of life, and eat, and <hi rend='italic'>live forever</hi>.</q> Gen. 3:22.

19. What was done to keep man away from the tree of life?

"If I wait, the grave is mine house."
Job 17:13.</head>

</p>

<p>
1. By what figure does the Bible represent death?
</p>

<p>
<q>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
them which are <hi rend='italic'>asleep</hi>, that ye sorrow not, even as
others which have no hope.</q> 1 Thess. 4:13. See also 1 Cor.
15:18, 20; John 11:11-14.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In sound sleep
one is wholly lost to consciousness; time goes
by unmeasured; and the mental functions which are active during consciousness
are suspended for the time being.
</quote>

<p>
2. Where do the dead sleep?
</p>

<p>
<q>And many of them that <hi rend='italic'>sleep in the dust of the earth</hi> shall
awake.</q> Dan. 12:2. See also Eccl. 3:20; 9:10.
</p>

<p>
3. How long will they sleep there?
</p>

<p>
<q>So man lieth down, and riseth not: <hi rend='italic'>till the heavens be no
more</hi>, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.</q>
Job 14:12.
</p>

<p>
4. For what did Job say he would wait after death?
</p>

<p>
<q>If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed
time will I wait, <hi rend='italic'>till my change come</hi>.</q> Verse 14.
</p>

<p>
5. Where did he say he would wait?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>If I wait, the grave is mine house</hi>: I have made my bed in
the darkness.</q> Job 17:13.
</p>

<pb n='512'/><anchor id='Pg512'/>

<p>
6. While in this condition, how much does one know about
those he has left behind?
</p>

<p>
<q>His sons come to honor, and <hi rend='italic'>he knoweth it not</hi>; and they
are brought low, but <hi rend='italic'>he perceiveth it not of them</hi>.</q> Job 14:21.
</p>

<p>
7. What becomes of man's thoughts at death?
</p>

<p>
<q>His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; <hi rend='italic'>in that
very day his thoughts perish</hi>.</q> Ps. 146:4.
</p>

<p>
8. Do the dead know <hi rend='italic'>anything</hi>?
</p>

<p>
<q>For the living know that they shall die: <hi rend='italic'>but the dead know
not anything</hi>, neither have they any more a reward; for the
memory of them is forgotten.</q> Eccl. 9:5.
</p>

<p>
9. Do they take any part in earthly things?
</p>

<p>
<q>Also their <hi rend='italic'>love</hi>, and
their <hi rend='italic'>hatred</hi>, and their <hi rend='italic'>envy</hi>, is now
<hi rend='italic'>perished; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything
that is done under the sun</hi>.</q> Verse 6.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;If one
continued in consciousness after death, he would know
of the promotion or dishonor of his sons. But Job says he does not know
this. Not only so, but in death one loses all the attributes of mind,&mdash;love,
hatred, envy, etc. Thus it is plain that his thoughts have perished,
and that he can have nothing more to do with the things of this
world. But if, as taught and held by some, man's powers of thought
continue after death, he <emph>lives</emph>; and
if he lives, he must be <emph>somewhere</emph>. Where
is he? Is he in heaven, or in hell? If he goes to either place at death,
what then is the need of a future judgment, or of a resurrection, or of the
second coming of Christ? If the judgment does not take place at death,
but men go to their reward at death, then their <emph>rewards</emph> precede their
<emph>awards</emph>, and there would arise the possibility that some have at death gone
to the wrong place, and must needs be sent to the other, after having been
in bliss or torment for ages, perhaps.

<p>
10. What does the psalmist say about the dead praising God?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>The dead praise not the Lord</hi>, neither any that go down
into silence.</q> Ps. 115:17.
</p>

<p>
11. How much does one know of God when dead?
</p>

<p>
<q>For in death <hi rend='italic'>there is no remembrance of Thee</hi>.</q> Ps. 6:5.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;There is not
even a remembrance of God. As already seen,
the Bible everywhere represents the dead as <emph>asleep</emph>. If they were in heaven
or in hell, would it be fitting to represent them thus? Was Lazarus, whom
Jesus loved, in heaven when the Saviour said, <q>Our friend Lazarus
<emph>sleepeth</emph></q>? John 11:11. If so, calling him to life was really robbing him
of the bliss of heaven that rightly belonged to him. The parable of the rich man
and Lazarus, recorded in Luke 16, was given to teach, not consciousness
in death, but that in the judgment riches will avail nothing unless rightly
and beneficently used, and that poverty will not keep one out of heaven.

<pb n='513'/><anchor id='Pg513'/>

<p>
12. But are not the righteous dead in heaven?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>David is not ascended into the heavens</hi>.</q> Acts 2:34.
</p>

<p>
13. What must take place before the dead can praise God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy dead men shall live, together with My dead body shall
they arise. <hi rend='italic'>Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust</hi>: for thy dew
is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.</q>
Isa. 26:19.
</p>

<p>
14. When did David say he would be satisfied?
</p>

<p>
<q>As for me, I will behold Thy face in righteousness: I shall
be satisfied, <hi rend='italic'>when I awake, with Thy likeness</hi>.</q> Ps. 17:15.
</p>

<p>
15. Were there to be no resurrection of the dead, what would
be the condition of those fallen asleep in Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if
Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.
<hi rend='italic'>Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.</hi></q>
1 Cor. 15:16-18.
</p>

<p>
16. When is the resurrection of the righteous to take place?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven</hi> with a
shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of
God: <hi rend='italic'>and the dead in Christ shall rise first</hi>.</q> 1 Thess. 4:16.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;If, as
stated in Eccl. 9:5, the dead know not anything,
then they have no knowledge of the lapse of time. <q>Six thousand years
in the grave to a dead man is no more than a wink of the eye to the living.</q>
To them, consciousness, our only means of measuring time, is gone; and it
will seem to them when they awake that absolutely no time has elapsed.
And herein lies a most comforting thought in the Bible doctrine of the sleep
of the dead, that in death there is no consciousness of the passing of time.
To those who sleep in Jesus, their sleep, whether long or short, whether
one year, one thousand years, or six thousand years, will be but as if the
moment of sad parting were followed instantly by the glad reunion in the
presence of Jesus at His glorious appearing and the resurrection of the just.
</p>

<p>
It ought also to be a comforting thought to those whose lives have
been filled with anxiety and grief for deceased loved ones who persisted
in sin, to know that they are not now suffering in torments, but, with all
the rest of the dead, are quietly sleeping in their graves. Job 3:17.
</p>

<p>
Again, it would mar the felicity of one's enjoyment in heaven could
he look upon earth and see his friends and relatives suffering from persecution,
want, cold, or hunger, or sorrowing for the dead. God's way is best,&mdash;that
all sentient life, animation, activity, thought, and consciousness
should cease at death, and that all should wait till the resurrection for
their future life and eternal reward. See Heb. 11:39, 40.

<p>
1. What comes to all men as the result of the fall?
</p>

<p>
<q>In Adam <hi rend='italic'>all die</hi>.</q> 1 Cor. 15:22. See also Rom. 5:12.
</p>

<p>
2. Where do all go at death?
</p>

<p>
<q>All go unto <hi rend='italic'>one place</hi>; all
are of <hi rend='italic'>the dust</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>all turn to dust
again</hi>.</q> Eccl. 3:20.
</p>

<p>
3. In what condition is man while in the grave?
</p>

<p>
<q>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might;
for <hi rend='italic'>there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the
grave, whither thou goest</hi>.</q> Eccl. 9:10.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;That is,
man, when dead, has no use of the powers of mind
or body. He cannot, therefore, while in the grave, praise God, or even
think of Him (Ps. 6:5); for in the day he dies his thoughts perish. Ps.
146:2-4. See preceding reading.
</quote>

<p>
4. What has been promised in order that man may be redeemed
from this condition?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem
them from death</hi>: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will
be thy destruction.</q> Hosea 13:14.
</p>

<p>
5. Through whom will come this redemption from the grave?
</p>

<p>
<q>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
<pb n='515'/><anchor id='Pg515'/>
of the dead. For as in Adam all die, <hi rend='italic'>even so in Christ
shall all be made alive</hi>.</q> 1 Cor. 15:21, 22.
</p>

<p>
6. What would have been the result to the dead had not
Christ procured their release from the grave?
</p>

<p>
<q>For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if
Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.
Then <hi rend='italic'>they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished</hi>.</q>
Verses 16-18.
</p>

<p>
7. Why did God give His only begotten Son to the world?
</p>

<p>
<q>For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten
Son, <hi rend='italic'>that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish</hi>, but have
everlasting life.</q> John 3:16.
</p>

<p>
8. What did the Sadducees in Christ's time deny?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then came to Him certain of the Sadducees, <hi rend='italic'>which deny
that there is any resurrection</hi>.</q> Luke 20:27.
</p>

<p>
9. How did Christ, from the Old Testament Scriptures,
prove the resurrection?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the
bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For He is not a God of the
dead, but of the living: for all live unto Him.</q> Verses 37, 38.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;That is, in
view of the resurrection&mdash;of the fact that there
is to be a resurrection&mdash;all live unto God. In His purpose, all are alive.
It is in this sense that Paul speaks of God as the one <q>who quickeneth the
dead, and <emph>calleth those things which be not as though they were</emph>.</q>
Rom. 4:17.
</quote>

<p>
10. Under what illustration from nature are the resurrection
and the final salvation of the righteous taught?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>That which thou sowest</hi> is not quickened, except it die.</q>
1 Cor. 15:36. <q>Verily, verily, I say unto you, <hi rend='italic'>Except a corn
of wheat fall into the ground and die</hi>, it abideth alone: but if it
die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</q> John 12:24.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;The seed
dies to spring forth into new life. In this we are
taught the lesson of the resurrection. All who love God will spring forth
to life, and live again through endless ages in the earth made new.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>The Open Grave.</hi>&mdash;The
truth of the resurrection has been forcibly
illustrated by the following incident: In the city of Hanover, Germany,
is a grave known as <q>The open grave.</q> It is that of a woman, an infidel
German princess, who died over one hundred years ago, and who, on her
death-bed, gave orders that her grave should be covered with a great
marble slab, weighing perhaps a ton, surmounting solid blocks of stone
firmly bound together with clasps of iron, with this inscription placed on
the lowermost stone of the tomb: <q>This grave purchased for eternity,
must never be opened.</q> But no human device can thwart the plans of
<pb n='517'/><anchor id='Pg517'/>
God, or hinder the workings of life from Him. It happened, providentially
no doubt, that a birch-tree seed was buried with the princess. Soon it
began to sprout. Its tiny shoot, soft and pliable at first, found its way up
through the ponderous stones of the massive masonry. Slowly and imperceptibly,
but with irresistible power, it grew, until at last it burst the
bands of iron asunder, and opened this never-to-be-opened grave, leaving
not a single stone in its original position. See illustration on page
<ref target='Pg498'>498</ref>.
What a rebuke to infidelity! and what a mute but striking promise that,
erelong, in God's own time, all graves shall be opened, and the sleeping
ones awake from their dusty beds!

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The wicked
are to be utterly destroyed&mdash;consumed away
into smoke, brought to ashes. Having inseparably allied themselves with
sin, they have forfeited the right to life and an immortal existence, and
chosen the way of death and destruction. By their choice they have
proved themselves worthless. For this reason they are compared to chaff,
briers, thorns, etc. Their destruction will consequently be no real loss.
They will themselves have lost their opportunity to obtain eternal life;
but by the way in which they used their probationary time they proved
themselves unworthy of it. Their destruction will, in fact, be an act of
love and mercy on the part of God; for to perpetuate their lives would only
be to perpetuate sin, sorrow, suffering, and misery. Terrible, therefore,
as this judgment will be, there will, in consequence of it, be nothing of
value lost,&mdash;nothing lost worth saving. The experiment of sin will be
over, and God's original plan of peopling the earth with a race of holy,
happy beings will be carried out. 2 Peter 3:13.

31. Before whom are we said to speak?
</p>

<p>
<q>Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou
shouldest vow and not pay. Suffer not thy mouth to cause

be present, to minister before God.

5. Before their entrance into Canaan, what instruction did
Moses give Israel concerning these things?
</p>

<p>
<q>When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God
giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations
of those nations. There shall not be found among you any one
that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire,
or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter,
or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar
spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these
things are an abomination unto the Lord: and because of these
abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before
thee. Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God.</q>
Deut. 18:9-13.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;Whoever
consults or has to do with mediums or any who
profess to receive instruction or communications from the spirits of the
dead, disregards this plain instruction, and places himself upon the enemy's
ground. Ever since Satan told that first lie in Eden, when he denied that
<emph>death</emph> would be the result of <emph>sin</emph>,
in the very face of death itself, he, working
upon man's natural dread of death and upon his distress at the thought
of being separated from loved ones, has been endeavoring to persuade
men to believe that the dead are not dead, and that men do not die. Idolatry,
heathenism, Spiritualism, occultism, and the whole brood of false isms
of this kind, it will be noticed, deal very largely with <emph>death</emph>. This, of
itself, indicates their origin, and should be a warning to all to let them alone&mdash;to
have nothing whatever to do with them. They are from beneath, and not
from above. However promising or pleasing they may be at first, they are
downward and destructive in their tendency, and ultimately lead away from
God, into unbelief of His Word and into sin. They promise life by denying
death, and apparently <q>make good</q> Satan's lie in Eden, through the
ministration and manifestations of evil angels representing themselves
to be the spirits of the dead.

<p>
In a sermon on <q>Spiritualism an Imposture,</q> Rev. T. De Witt Talmage
said: <q>Spiritualism takes advantage of those who are weak and morbid
<pb n='535'/><anchor id='Pg535'/>
with trouble. We lose a friend. The house is dark, the world is dark,
the future seems dark. If we had, in our rebellion and weakness, the
power to marshal a host and recapture our loved one, we should marshal
the host. Spiritualism comes in at that moment, when we are all worn out
by watching,&mdash;all worn out, body, mind, and soul,&mdash;and says: <q>Now I
will open that door; you shall hear the voices. Take your places around
the table; all be quiet now.</q> ... O, I hate Spiritualism, because it
takes advantage of people when they are weak, and worn out, and morbid
under life's bereavements and sorrows!... If Spiritualism had its
way, it would turn the world into a pandemonium of carnality. It is an
unclean and adulterous system.</q>

Writing concerning <q>Communion With the Departed,</q> General
Booth, of the Salvation Army, said: <q>Through all my history, my personal
intercourse with the spirit world has been but limited. I have not been
favored with many visions, and it is but seldom that I dream dreams that
impart either pleasure or profit; and yet I have a spiritual communion
with the departed saints that is not without both satisfaction and service.
And especially of late the memories of those with whom my heart has had
the choicest communion in the past, if not the very beings themselves, have
come in upon me as I have sat at my desk or lain wakeful on my bed in the
night-season. Amongst these, one form, true to her mission, comes more
frequently than all besides, assuring me of her continued partnership in
my struggle for the temporal and eternal salvation of the multitudes&mdash;and
that is my blessed, my beautiful wife!</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>War

<q>Dr. Joseph Parker, of the City Temple, London, has openly declared
that he prayed to his departed wife every day. He said that he
never came to the City Temple to preach without asking her to come with

pray God to ask her to come to his help. She will be more to him than

In a statement given put Dec. 20, 1910, soon after the death of Mrs.
Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, Mrs. Amelia Stetson, one of the
leaders of the Christian Science Church of New York City, said: <q>Mrs.
Eddy, who was the female Christ, will return to earth. I am watching
and waiting for the manifestation of Mrs. Eddy in the semblance of human
form. It may come today, it may come next week, it may not come for
ten years, but it will surely come.... The millennium is at hand.
Mrs. Eddy is not dead. She is still alive, and when she appears again on
earth, it will be as herself&mdash;as Mary Baker Eddy.</q>

<q>A message purporting to come from Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy, the

and to virtue <hi rend='italic'>knowledge</hi>;
and to knowledge <hi rend='italic'>temperance</hi> [self-control]; and to temperance
<hi rend='italic'>patience</hi>; and to patience

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;<emph>Faith</emph>
is the first round in the Christian ladder, the first
step Godward. <q>He that cometh to God must <emph>believe</emph>.</q> Heb. 11:6.
</p>

<pb n='542'/><anchor id='Pg542'/>

<p>
But an inoperative faith is useless. <q>Faith without <emph>works</emph> is dead.</q>
James 2:20. To be of value, there must be coupled with faith that <emph>virtue</emph>,
or <emph>courage of conviction</emph>, which impels to <emph>action</emph>.
</p>

<p>
To courage there needs to be added <emph>knowledge</emph>; otherwise, like the
stumbling Jews, one may have a zeal, <q>but <emph>not according to knowledge</emph>.</q>
Rom. 10:2. Fanaticism is the result of such courage, or zeal. Knowledge,
therefore, is an essential to healthy Christian growth.
</p>

<p>
To knowledge there needs to be added <emph>temperance</emph>,
or <emph>self-control</emph>&mdash;<emph>self-government</emph>.
See Acts 24:25, American Standard Version, and margin
of Revised Version. To know to do good, and not do it, is as useless
as is faith without works. See James 4:17. Instead of <emph>temperance</emph>,
the Twentieth Century New Testament invariably says <emph>self-control</emph>.
</p>

<p>
<emph>Patience</emph> naturally follows <emph>temperance</emph>.
It is well-nigh impossible for
an intemperate person to be <emph>patient</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Having gained control of oneself, and become patient, one is in a
condition to manifest <emph>godliness</emph>, or <emph>God-likeness</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Having become godly, <emph>kindness toward the brethren</emph>,
or <emph>brotherly kindness</emph>,
naturally follows.
</p>

<p>
<emph>Charity</emph>, or love for <emph>all</emph>, even
our <emph>enemies</emph>, is the crowning grace, the
highest step, the eighth round, in the Christian ladder.
</p>

<p>
The arrangement in this enumeration of graces is by no means accidental
or haphazard, but logical and sequential, each following the other
in natural, necessary order. The finger of Inspiration is seen here.

1. How important is it that we walk in the light when it
comes to us?
</p>

<p>
<q>Walk while ye have the light, <hi rend='italic'>lest darkness come upon you</hi>:
for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</q>
John 12:35.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;It
is important to settle a plain question of duty at once,
and not delay obedience under the excuse of waiting for more light. To
do as did Balaam&mdash;ask God again concerning that which He has plainly
and expressly spoken&mdash;is dangerous. Nor should we, like the unbelieving
Jews, seek a sign from heaven to convince us that we ought to obey the
written Word. Has God spoken? Is it His word? Then obey. Do not
insult Heaven with the question whether it is right to obey. If one gets
an answer to such prayers, it will more than likely be a permission to
have one's own chosen way of continuing in disobedience, the end of which
is death. See 1 Kings 22:1-36; Eze. 14:1-5.

<p>
2. Upon what condition are we promised cleansing from sin?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light</hi>, we have
fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His
Son cleanseth us from all sin.</q> 1 John 1:7.
</p>

<p>
3. How long may the just expect increased light to shine
upon their pathway?
</p>

<p>
<q>But the path of the just is as the shining light, <hi rend='italic'>that shineth
more and more unto the perfect day</hi>.</q> Prov. 4:18.
</p>

<p>
4. For whom is light sown?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Light is sown for the righteous</hi>, and gladness for the upright
in heart.</q> Ps. 97:11.
</p>

<pb n='548'/><anchor id='Pg548'/>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
more earnestly one desires to know the will of God,
while living up to all the light he has, the more light and truth from God
will shine upon his pathway. The fact that one has the evidence of his
acceptance with God, is no proof that he has all the light there is for
him. If light is sown for the righteous, such are the very ones who may
expect advanced light to come to them, and to see new duties presented
to them from a study of the Word of God.
</quote>

<p>
5. Who was told by an angel of God that his ways pleased
the Lord?
</p>

<p>
<q>He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the
day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him,
<hi rend='italic'>Cornelius</hi>. And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said,
What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine
alms are come up for a memorial before God.</q> Acts 10:3, 4.
</p>

<p>
6. Because Cornelius's ways pleased the Lord, was this
evidence that he had nothing more to learn or do?
</p>

<p>
<q>And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose
surname is Peter: he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose
house is by the seaside: <hi rend='italic'>he shall tell
thee what thou oughtest to do</hi>.</q>
Verses 5, 6.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
reason why the Lord favored Cornelius with a visit
from one of His angels, was not because Cornelius knew the way of salvation
perfectly, but because the Lord saw in him a sincere desire for more
light, and a willing mind to comply with every known requirement. That
spirit was pleasing to God, and He therefore opened the way for Cornelius
to learn the whole truth from Peter, that he might be saved. God never
changes. He does the same now with sincere, devoted persons. All may
now receive advanced light, if, like Cornelius, they seek it, and are willing
to walk in it when it comes to them. If it is neglected, they are guilty
before God, and will be left to the buffetings of the enemy.
</quote>

<p>
7. What will become of the light which one has if he fails
to walk in it?
</p>

<p>
<q>The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye
is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye
is evil, thy body also is full of darkness. <hi rend='italic'>Take heed therefore
that the light which is in thee be not darkness.</hi></q> Luke 11:34, 35.
</p>

<p>
8. Why did Christ say that the sin of those who rejected
Him remained?
</p>

<p>
<q>Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no
sin: but now ye say, <hi rend='italic'>We see</hi>; therefore your sin remaineth.</q>
John 9:41. See also John 15:22.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;With advanced
light comes increased responsibility. Duty
is always in proportion to one's light and privileges. Present truth always
brings with it present duty. See reading on <q>Present Truth,</q> page

<p>
9. Why are those condemned that do not come to the light?
</p>

<p>
<q>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the
world, and <hi rend='italic'>men loved darkness rather than light, because their
deeds were evil</hi>.</q> John 3:19.
</p>

<p>
10. If one is really seeking for truth, what will he do?
</p>

<p>
<q>But he that doeth truth <hi rend='italic'>cometh to the light</hi>, that his
deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</q>
Verse 21.
</p>

<p>
11. What will those who reject light and truth, finally be
led to believe?
</p>

<p>
<q>And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion,
<hi rend='italic'>that they should believe a lie</hi>: that they all might be damned who
believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</q>
2 Thess. 2:11, 12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
opposite of light is darkness; the opposite of truth is a
lie. For those who reject light and truth, only darkness and error remain.
God is sometimes in the Scriptures represented as sending that which he
permits to come. See Ps. 81:12; 1 Kings 22:20-23; Rom. 1:21-28.

my feet, and <hi rend='italic'>a light</hi> unto my path.</q>
Ps. 119:105. See Prov. 6:23.

<p>
15. What does the entrance of God's word give?
</p>

<p>
<q>The entrance of Thy word <hi rend='italic'>giveth light</hi>; it giveth understanding
unto the simple.</q> Ps. 119:130.
</p>

<p>
16. Who does Christ say will be blessed through the prophecies
of the book of Revelation?
</p>

<p>
<q>Blessed is <hi rend='italic'>he that readeth</hi>,
and <hi rend='italic'>they that hear</hi> the words of
this prophecy, <hi rend='italic'>and keep those things which are written therein</hi>.</q>
Rev. 1:3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;We are

<p>
1. What is faith?
</p>

<p>
<q>Faith is the <hi rend='italic'>substance</hi>
[margin, <hi rend='italic'>ground</hi>, or <hi rend='italic'>confidence</hi>] of
things hoped for, the <hi rend='italic'>evidence</hi> of things not seen.</q> Heb. 11:1.
</p>

<p>
2. How important is faith?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Without faith it is impossible to please Him</hi>: for he that
cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder
of them that diligently seek Him.</q> Verse 6.

3. How only can we truly know God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, <hi rend='italic'>and
he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him</hi>.</q> Matt. 11:27.
</p>

<p>
4. In whom must we believe in order to be saved?
</p>

<p>
<q>For God so loved the world, that He gave <hi rend='italic'>His only begotten
Son</hi>, that whosoever believeth in <hi rend='italic'>Him</hi> should not perish
but have everlasting life.</q> John 3:16.
</p>

<p>
5. What challenge does the apostle James make as to the
evidence that one has genuine faith?
</p>

<p>
<q>Show me thy faith <hi rend='italic'>without</hi> thy works, and I will show thee
my faith <hi rend='italic'>by</hi> my works.</q> James 2:18.
</p>

<p>
6. How did Abraham show that he had perfect faith in God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, <hi rend='italic'>when he
had offered Isaac his son upon the altar</hi>? Seest thou how faith
<pb n='552'/><anchor id='Pg552'/>
wrought with his works, and <hi rend='italic'>by works was faith made perfect</hi>?</q>
Verses 21, 22.
</p>

<p>
7. By what practical example does the apostle illustrate the
difference between genuine, living faith, and a dead faith?
</p>

<p>
<q>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed
and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which
are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</q> Verses 15, 16.
</p>

<p>
8. How necessary are works in maintaining living faith?
</p>

<p>
<q>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that <hi rend='italic'>faith without works
is dead</hi>?... For <hi rend='italic'>as the body without the spirit</hi> [margin,
<hi rend='italic'>breath</hi>] <hi rend='italic'>is dead,
so faith without works is dead also</hi>.</q> Verses 20-26.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;The apostle
was not here arguing for justification or salvation
by faith <emph>and</emph> works, but for a living faith&mdash;a
faith <emph>that</emph> works.
</p>

<p>
<q>There are two errors against which the children of God&mdash;particularly
those who have just come to trust in His grace&mdash;especially need
to guard. The first ... is that of looking to their own works, trusting
to anything they can do, to bring themselves into harmony with God.
He who is trying to become holy by his own works in keeping the law, is
attempting an impossibility. All that man can do without Christ is
polluted with selfishness and sin. It is the grace of Christ alone, through
faith, that can make us holy. The opposite and no less dangerous error
is that belief in Christ releases men from keeping the law of God; that
since by faith alone we become partakers of the grace of Christ, our works
have nothing to do with our redemption.... Obedience&mdash;the
service and allegiance of love&mdash;is the true sign of discipleship....
Instead of releasing man from obedience, it is faith, and faith only, that
makes us partakers of the grace of Christ, which enables us to render
obedience. We do not earn salvation by our obedience; for salvation is
the free gift of God, to be received by faith. But obedience is the fruit
of faith.... That so-called faith in Christ which professes to release
men from the obligation of obedience to God, is not faith, but
presumption.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>Steps
to Christ,</q> pages 64-66.</hi>
</p>

<p>
Says Luther: <q>If Christ alone takes away sin, we cannot do so by all
our works. But good works follow redemption as surely as fruit appears
upon a living tree.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>D'Aubigne's <q>History
of the Reformation,</q></hi> book
2, chap. 6.
</p>
</quote>

<p>
9. What does the hope of salvation lead one to do?
</p>

<p>
<q>And every man that hath this hope in Him <hi rend='italic'>purifieth himself</hi>,
even as He is pure.</q> 1 John 3:3.
</p>

<p>
10. Upon what condition are we made partakers of Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>For we are made partakers of Christ, <hi rend='italic'>if we hold the beginning
of our confidence steadfast unto the end</hi>.</q> Heb. 3:14.
</p>

<p>
11. Upon what conditions has God promised us cleansing
and the forgiveness of our sins?
</p>

<pb n='553'/><anchor id='Pg553'/>

<p>
<q>But <hi rend='italic'>if we walk in the light</hi>, as He is in the light, we have
fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ
His Son cleanseth us from all sin.... <hi rend='italic'>If we confess our
sins</hi>, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse
us from all unrighteousness.</q> 1 John 1:7-9.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Intelligent faith
as to what God will do for us touching any
matter must be gained by what God's Word says concerning that point.
No one can consistently hope for that which God has not promised. To
expect that God will do that which He has never promised to do is only
presumption. Faith is distinct from presumption. To have abiding
confidence in the promise of God is faith; but presumption may rest entirely
on feeling or desire. Feeling cannot therefore be relied on in the
matter of faith. Faith is a pure belief, a confiding trust, in the promises
of God, irrespective of feeling. This perfect trust enables one to surmount
difficulties under the most trying circumstances, even when the feelings
are depressed or well-nigh crushed.
</quote>

<p>
12. Upon what, then, is genuine, saving faith based?
</p>

<p>
<q>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by <hi rend='italic'>the word of God</hi>.</q>
Rom. 10:17.
</p>

<p>
13. What was the cause of Peter's sinking after he had
started to meet the Saviour on the stormy sea?
</p>

<p>
<q>And immediately Jesus stretched forth His hand, and
caught him, and said unto him, <hi rend='italic'>O thou of little faith, wherefore
didst thou doubt?</hi></q> Matt. 14:31.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
boisterous sea caused Peter to doubt the strength of

14. With what is it our privilege to be filled?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now the God of hope <hi rend='italic'>fill you
with all joy and peace in believing</hi>,
that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the
Holy Ghost.</q> Rom. 15:13.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Faith may
be strengthened by daily exercise. It is not
some great thing, done once for all, that gives an individual faith; but an
every-day, simple, childlike trust in God, and an implicit obedience to
His Word. Some make faith a more difficult matter than God would
have them, because they try to embrace too much at one time. They
take on the burdens of tomorrow or next week, when the Lord supplies
strength only for <emph>today</emph>. When tomorrow comes, grapple with its duties,
but not until it does come. We should remember the precious promise,
<q>As thy days, so shall thy strength be.</q> Deut. 33:25.

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Says
a Christian writer: <q>Our sorrows do not spring out of
the ground. God <q>doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.</q>
When He permits trials and afflictions, it is <q>for our profit, that we might
be partakers of His holiness.</q> If received in faith, the trial that seems so
bitter and hard to bear will prove a blessing. The cruel blow that blights
the joys of earth will be the means of turning our eyes to heaven. How
many there are who would never have known Jesus had not sorrow led
them to seek comfort in Him! The trials of life are God's workmen, to
remove the impurities and roughness from our character. Their hewing,
squaring, and chiseling, and their burnishing and polishing, is a painful
process. It is hard to be pressed down to the grinding-wheel. But the
stone is brought forth prepared to fill its place in the heavenly temple.</q>

11. What did it lead Moses to do?
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<q>There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or

2. With what are we exhorted to be content?

<q>But they that will be rich <hi rend='italic'>fall into temptation and a snare,

neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how
much more are ye better than the fowls?... <hi rend='italic'>Consider the
lilies</hi> how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say
unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one
of these. If then God so clothe the grass, which is today in the

<p>
<q>While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and
cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall

produces, in some measure, all those effects

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;<q>There
are those who take to gloom as a bat to darkness
or as a vulture to carrion. They would rather nurse a misery than cherish
a joy. They always find the dark side of everything, if there is a dark
side to be found. They appear to be conscientious grumblers, as if it were
their duty to extract some essence of misery from every circumstance....
On the other hand, there are rare spirits who always take cheerful
views of life. They look at the bright side. They find some joy and
beauty everywhere.... In the most faulty picture they see some
bit of beauty which charms them. In the most disagreeable person they
discover some kindly trait or some bud of promise. In the most disheartening
circumstances they find something for which to be thankful, some gleam
of cheer breaking through the thick gloom.... When a ray of sunlight
streamed through a crack in the shutter and made a bright patch on
the floor in the darkened room, the little dog rose from his dark corner and
went and lay down in the one sunny spot; and these people live in the same
philosophical way. If there is one beam of cheer or hope anywhere in
their lot, they will find it.... We have no right to project the gloom
of our discontent over any other life. Our ministry is to be ever toward
joy. There is nothing so depressing in its effects upon others as morbidness....
Discontent helps nothing.... One never feels better
for complaining.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>Week-Day

To give way to gloomy thoughts, otherwise the <q>blues,</q> is a sign of weakness.
This isn't asserting that no one but weaklings is attacked by the
blues; but it is one thing to be attacked and another to rout the disturber.
And that is what the brave soul does. There may be a very real and
tangible reason why the heart faints and halts, for life is serious, and the
world full of unexpected trials; but to sit and brood over a trouble only
makes it look larger and larger until it finally obscures the horizon line,
and darkness descends upon the soul. Wherefore, the thing to do is to
cast aside all thoughts of worry for a moment,&mdash;just say to yourself, It
is only for a moment,&mdash;and when you return to it again you will be surprised
to find it has lessened in size and

1. What has God promised to do when we confess our sins?

<p>
<q>If we confess our sins, <hi rend='italic'>He is faithful and just to forgive us
our sins</hi>, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</q> 1 John

</p>

<p>
3. To whom should sins be confessed, and why?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned</hi>, and done this evil
in Thy sight.</q> Ps. 51:4. See Gen. 39:9.
</p>

<p>
4. What instruction is given concerning confession of faults?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Confess your faults one to another</hi>, and pray one for another,
that ye may be healed.</q> James 5:16.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;The Bible makes
a distinction between a sin and a fault.
We sin against God; for sin is the transgression of His law. 1 John 3:4.
</p>

<pb n='578'/><anchor id='Pg578'/>

<p>
We trespass one against another. These offenses, while involving sin,
are called faults, and should be corrected by confession and forgiveness.
The only remedy for either pointed out in the Word of God is heartfelt
confession. One writer aptly says: <q>Confess your sins to God, who only
can forgive them, and your faults to one another. If you have given offense
to your friend or neighbor, you are to acknowledge your wrong, and it is
his duty freely to forgive you. Then you are to seek the forgiveness of
God, because the brother you have wounded is the property of God, and
in injuring him you sinned against his Creator and Redeemer.</q>
</p>

<p>
To confess one's faults is not an easy thing to do; in fact, it is one of
the hardest lessons to learn, for it requires the grace of humility as well as
that of sorrow and true repentance. It has been said that the four hardest
words to pronounce in the English language are, <q>I made a mistake.</q>
Frederick the Great wrote to the Prussian senate, <q>I have just lost a
battle, and it is my own fault.</q> Concerning this Goldsmith says, <q>His
confession shows more greatness than his victories.</q>
</p>

<p>
The confession should not only be complete, but it should be as broad
and as public as was the offense. Private offenses should be confessed
in private.
</p>
</quote>

<p>
5. When we do wrong, what is the natural thing for us to do?
</p>

<p>
Excuse it, seek to hide it, or blame some one else for it.
See Gen. 3:12, 13; 4:9.
</p>

<p>
6. After David's great sin had been pointed out to him, what
did he say?
</p>

<p>
<q>I have sinned.</q> 2 Sam. 12:13. <q>I acknowledge my
transgressions.</q> Ps. 51:3.
</p>

<p>
7. When David in contrition of heart confessed his sin, what
was God's word to him by Nathan, the prophet?
</p>

<p>
<q>And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the
Lord. And Nathan said unto David, <hi rend='italic'>The Lord also hath put
away thy sin</hi>; thou shalt not die.</q> 2 Sam. 12:13.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This
scripture is especially encouraging. God hates sin.
He wants us likewise to hate it and shun it, because it invariably gets us
into trouble, causes sorrow of heart, and in the end brings death. But
when involved in it, as was David, as soon as it is acknowledged and sincerely
confessed, <emph>that very moment it is forgiven</emph>. David said, <q>I have
<emph>sinned</emph>.</q> The immediate answer was returned,
<q>The Lord also <emph>hath put
away thy sin</emph>.</q>
</quote>

<p>
8. Is it ever right to tell a brother of his faults?
</p>

<p>
<q>If thy brother shall trespass against thee, <hi rend='italic'>go and tell him
his fault between thee and him alone</hi>: if he shall hear thee, thou
hast gained thy brother.</q> Matt. 18:15. <q>Thou shalt not
hate thy brother in thine heart: <hi rend='italic'>thou shalt in any wise rebuke
thy neighbor, and not suffer sin upon him</hi>.</q> Lev. 19:17.
</p>

<p>
9. In what spirit should this kind of work be done?
</p>

<pb n='579'/><anchor id='Pg579'/>

<p>
<q>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are
spiritual, restore such an one <hi rend='italic'>in
the spirit of meekness</hi>; considering
thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</q> Gal. 6:1.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;It is
much easier to tell <emph>some one else</emph> of a brother's faults
than it is to tell <emph>him</emph> of them <emph>himself</emph>;
but this is not the Christian way to proceed. The first efforts should
be made with the offender <emph>in person</emph>,
and <emph>alone</emph>. But it is easier even to tell <emph>a brother</emph>
of <emph>his</emph> faults than it is to confess
to him <emph>our own</emph>. This, again, let it be noted, is the one very difficult
lesson to learn, the one Christian duty difficult to perform. Only
humility and the grace of God will enable one to do it.

10. When we pray, what does Christ tell us to do, and why?
</p>

<p>
<q>And when ye stand praying, <hi rend='italic'>forgive</hi>, if ye have aught

which is in heaven <hi rend='italic'>may forgive
you your trespasses</hi>.</q> Mark 11:25.
</p>

<p>
11. If we do not forgive others, what will God not do?
</p>

<p>
<q>But if ye do not forgive, <hi rend='italic'>neither will your Father which is

Christ's parable recorded in Matt. 18:23-35.

<p>
12. What words of Joseph to his brethren show that he forgave
them for selling him into Egypt?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now therefore <hi rend='italic'>be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves,

life.... <hi rend='italic'>So now it was not you that sent me hither, but
God.</hi></q> Gen. 45:5-8.
</p>

<p>
13. What was Christ's reply to Peter's question as to the
number of times we should forgive one another?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall
my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
Jesus saith unto him, <hi rend='italic'>I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but,
Until seventy times seven</hi>.</q> Matt. 18:21, 22.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

is, an unlimited number. We must pardon offenses
against us though ever so often done; we must forgive to the end.

on earth would indeed be a symbol of the church in heaven if its members
were of one mind and of one faith. It is those who are not moved by the
Holy Spirit that mar God's plan, and cause division, and strengthen the
forces of darkness. Those who are sanctified by the blood of Christ will
not counterwork God's work, nor perpetuate division in the church. When
there is disunion among believers, the world concludes that they cannot be
the people of God because they are working against one another. When
believers are one with Christ, they will be united among themselves.</q>

and the sea, and the fountains of waters.... Babylon is
fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations
drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.... If
any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark
in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine
of the wrath of God.</q> Rev. 14:7-10. See Rev. 18:1-5.

7. By what means did Jesus illustrate true humility?
</p>

<p>
<q>And Jesus called <hi rend='italic'>a little child</hi> unto Him, and set him in the
midst of them, and said, ... <hi rend='italic'>Whosoever therefore shall
humble himself as this little child; the same is greatest in the kingdom
of heaven.</hi></q> Matt. 18:2-4.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;Humility
is <q>freedom from pride and arrogance; lowliness
of mind; a modest estimate of one's own worth.</q> It implies a sense of
one's own unworthiness through imperfection and sinfulness, and consists
in rating our <emph>claims</emph> low, in being willing to
<emph>waive our rights</emph>, and to <emph>take
a lower place than might be our due</emph>. It does not require that we under-rate
ourselves or our life-work. The humility of Christ was perfect, yet
He had a true sense of the importance of His life and mission.
</p>

<p>
<q>Humility is like a tree, whose root, when it sets deepest in the earth,
rises higher, and spreads fairer, and stands surer, and lasts longer, and every
step of its descent is like a rib of iron.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Bishop Taylor.</hi>
</p>
</quote>

<p>
8. How will humility lead us to esteem others?
</p>

<p>
<q>Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in
lowliness of mind <hi rend='italic'>let each esteem other better than themselves</hi>.</q>
Phil. 2:3.
</p>

<p>
9. With whom does God dwell?
</p>

<p>
<q>I dwell in the high and holy place, <hi rend='italic'>with him also that is of
a contrite and humble spirit</hi>, to revive the spirit of the humble,
and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</q> Isa. 57:15.
</p>

<p>
10. When asked a reason for our hope, in what spirit should
we answer?
</p>

<p>
<q>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready
always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason
of the hope that is in you <hi rend='italic'>with meekness and fear</hi>.</q> 1 Peter
3:15.
</p>

<p>
11. Who should labor for one overtaken in a fault, and in
what spirit?
</p>

<p>
<q>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, <hi rend='italic'>ye which are
spiritual</hi>, restore such an one <hi rend='italic'>in
the spirit of meekness</hi>; considering
thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</q> Gal. 6:1.
</p>

<pb n='588'/><anchor id='Pg588'/>

<p>
12. With what should Christian women adorn themselves?
</p>

<p>
<q>Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting
the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;
but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not
corruptible, even <hi rend='italic'>the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit</hi>, which
is in the sight of God of great price.</q> 1 Peter 3:3, 4.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The instruction given
here, <emph>in principle</emph> applies with equal
force to men professing godliness. It is the needless display of apparel
and outward adornment that is here condemned. God desires the ornaments
<emph>within</emph>, displayed in the heart
and life, rather than those <emph>without</emph>,
simply to be seen of men. Needless outward adornment, therefore, may
generally be taken as an indication that the inward adornment, so precious
in the sight of God, is lacking. Neatness in dress is not here discouraged.

<p>
13. Why are we exhorted to humble ourselves?
</p>

<p>
<q>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of

14. With what has the Lord promised to beautify the meek?
</p>

<p>
<q>For the Lord taketh pleasure in His people: <hi rend='italic'>He will beautify
the meek with salvation</hi>.</q> Ps. 149:4.
</p>

<p>
15. What are the meek exhorted to seek?
</p>

<p>
<q>Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have
wrought His judgment; seek righteousness, <hi rend='italic'>seek meekness</hi>: it may
be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger.</q> Zeph. 2:3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
fact that the meek are exhorted to seek meekness, is
evidence that the meek themselves should cherish and cultivate meekness,
and that sanctification, or the development of a perfect character, is a
progressive work.

16. What inheritance is promised the meek?

Prov. 4:7.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

<p>
1. What general command has God given concerning labor?
</p>

<p>
<q>Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work.</q> Ex. 20:9.
</p>

<p>
2. Instead of living upon the earnings of others, what instruction
is given?
</p>

<p>
<q>Let him that stole steal no more: but rather <hi rend='italic'>let him labor,
working with his hands</hi> the thing which is good, that he may have
to give to him that needeth.</q> Eph. 4:28.
</p>

<p>
3. What general rule does Paul lay down upon this subject?
</p>

<p>
<q>For even when we were with you, this we commanded you,
that <hi rend='italic'>if any would not work, neither
should he eat</hi>.</q> 2 Thess. 3:10.
</p>

<p>
4. In what language does he condemn idleness?
</p>

<p>
<q>For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly,
<hi rend='italic'>working not at all</hi>, but are busybodies. Now them that
are such <hi rend='italic'>we command and exhort</hi>
by our Lord Jesus Christ, <hi rend='italic'>that
with quietness they work, and eat their own bread</hi>.</q> Verses 11, 12.
</p>

<p>
5. What example did the apostle himself set in this matter?
</p>

<p>
<q>Neither did we eat any man's bread for naught; but <hi rend='italic'>wrought
with labor and travail night and day</hi>, that we might not be chargeable
to any of you.</q> Verse 8.
</p>

<pb n='595'/><anchor id='Pg595'/>

<p>
6. What labor was appointed man in consequence of the fall?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread</hi>, till thou return
unto the ground.</q> Gen. 3:19.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;A life
of laborious and perpetual toil, in a world cursed with
weeds, thorns, and thistles, was appointed to man in consequence of the
entrance of sin. This was a part of the curse. And yet even this was
appointed in love, and, under existing circumstances, is a blessing in disguise.
It was a discipline rendered necessary because of sin, to place a
check upon the indulgence of appetite and passion, to develop habits of
industry and self-control, and to teach lessons on overcoming evil. Were
not man called to labor thus, his sins and miseries would be multiplied
manyfold.

<p>
7. What are some of the results of industry?
</p>

<p>
<q>He that tilleth his land <hi rend='italic'>shall have plenty of bread</hi>.</q> Prov.
28:19. <q>The hand of the diligent <hi rend='italic'>maketh rich</hi>.</q> Prov. 10:4.
<q>The soul of the diligent shall be <hi rend='italic'>made fat</hi>.</q> Prov. 13:4.
</p>

<p>
8. What results from slackness and indolence in business?
</p>

<p>
<q>He <hi rend='italic'>becometh poor</hi> that dealeth with a slack hand.</q> Prov.
10:4. <q>The soul of the sluggard desireth, and <hi rend='italic'>hath nothing</hi>.</q>
Prov. 13:4.
</p>

<p>
9. What does Solomon say concerning diligence in business?
</p>

<p>
<q>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.</q>
Eccl. 9:10. <q>Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks,
and look well to thy herds.</q> Prov. 27:23. <q>He that gathereth
in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son
that causeth shame.</q> Prov. 10:5.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;<q>The
way to wealth, if you desire it, is as plain as the way
to market. It depends chiefly on two words&mdash;<emph>industry</emph>
and <emph>frugality</emph>; that is, waste neither <emph>time</emph>
nor <emph>money</emph>, but make the best of both. Without
industry and frugality nothing will do, and with
them everything.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Benjamin
Franklin.</hi>
</quote>

<p>
10. What does Solomon say of the industrious woman?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not
the bread of idleness.</hi> Her children arise up, and call her blessed;
her husband also, and he praiseth her.</q> Prov. 31:27, 28.
</p>

<p>
11. What has Paul said of the professed Christian who does
not provide for his own family?
</p>

<p>
<q>But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those
of his own house, <hi rend='italic'>he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an
infidel</hi>.</q> 1 Tim. 5:8.
</p>

<p>
12. What picture has Solomon given of the slothful man?
</p>

<p>
<q>I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of
the man void of understanding; and, lo, it was all grown over
<pb n='596'/><anchor id='Pg596'/>
with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the
stone wall thereof was broken down.</q> Prov. 24:30, 31.

<p>
<q>Luck is waiting for something to turn up. Labor, with keen eyes
and strong will, will turn up something. Luck whines. Labor whistles.
Luck relies on chances. Labor, on character. Luck slips down to indigence.
Labor strides upward to independence. Luck lies in bed, and
wishes the postman would bring him news of a legacy. Labor turns out
at six o' clock, and with busy pen or ringing hammer lays the foundation
of a competence.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Cobden.</hi>

13. In spiritual matters, what is also necessary?
</p>

<p>
<q>And beside this, <hi rend='italic'>giving all diligence</hi>, add to your faith virtue;
and to virtue knowledge.... Give <hi rend='italic'>diligence</hi> to make
your calling and election sure.</q> 2 Peter 1:5-10.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In
temporal matters the difference between a prosperous
man and a sluggard lies principally in the improvement of opportunities.
One grasps these, while the other is too indolent to do so. In the gaining
of eternal life this same principle applies. God has placed salvation
within the reach of all. None need be lost. Christ died for all, but all
will not be saved, for some do not care enough for eternal life diligently
to lay hold of it.

<q>Good and evil come back.... God made the universe on the

14. When praying, what must we do in order to be forgiven?

<p>
15. With what should our prayers be mingled?

5. With what adversary do we constantly have to contend?

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Paul's

<q>Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and
<hi rend='italic'>he prayed earnestly</hi> that it might

<q>And this is the confidence that we have in Him, that, <hi rend='italic'>if
we ask anything according to His will</hi>, He heareth us: and if we

College, Constantinople, with the sad news: <q>It is all over with us; we have

to prayer. The next day the sultan died, and the decree was never executed.

desired of the Lord, that I will seek after; that I may <hi rend='italic'>dwell</hi> in
the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty
of the Lord, and to inquire in His temple.</q> Ps. 84:4; 27:4.
</p>

<p>
12. What caution is given regarding behavior in God's house?
</p>

<p>
<q>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be
more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they

<head>Rules On Going To Church</head>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
1. Go early to church. Not only be punctual, but be in your place
before the hour announced for the service to begin.
</p>

<p>
2. Go in a reverent spirit. On the way remember whither you go.
Avoid lightness of manner and conversation on worldly topics.
</p>

<p>
3. Before you enter and as you enter the church breathe a silent
prayer of invocation for the influence of the Holy Spirit.
</p>

<p>
4. As you take your place, bow your head reverently in prayer for
yourself and for all others who enter the sanctuary.
</p>

<p>
5. Resolve that you will foster no thought, fix your eyes on no object,
utter no word, that will tend to divert your mind from the holy purpose
for which you have come into this place.
</p>

<p>
6. As the minister enters the pulpit, offer an earnest silent prayer in
his behalf.
</p>

<p>
7. In all the service take an active part, as hearer, as worshiper.
</p>

<p>
8. At the close of the service, after a moment of prayerful silence,
greet with cheerfulness and good will all whom you happen to meet, remembering
that Christian fellowship is a part of Christian worship.&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Bishop
Vincent.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;An excellent suggestion is
contained in the notice posted at
the doorway of many churches: <q>Whosoever thou art that entereth this
church, remember it is the house of God. Be reverent, be silent, be
thoughtful. And leave it not without a prayer to God, for thyself, for
him who ministers, and for those who worship here.</q>

<head>Reverence For The House Of God</head>

<p rend='text-align: center'>

    <head>A Jewish Synagogue.
"Ye shall keep My Sabbaths, and reverence
My sanctuary." Lev. 19:30.</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
1. Why did God instruct His people to build a sanctuary?
</p>

<p>
<q>And let them make Me a sanctuary; <hi rend='italic'>that I may dwell among
them</hi>.</q> Ex. 25:8.
</p>

<p>
2. How did He tell them to regard this dwelling-place of
God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Ye shall keep My Sabbaths, and <hi rend='italic'>reverence My sanctuary</hi>:
I am the Lord.</q> Lev. 19:30.
</p>

<p>
3. What does the Lord say of things dedicated to His service?
</p>

<p>
<q>Every devoted thing is <hi rend='italic'>most holy</hi> unto the Lord.</q> Lev.
27:28.
</p>

<p>
4. When God met Moses at the burning bush, why did He
tell him to take off his shoes?
</p>

<p>
<q>And He said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet,
<hi rend='italic'>for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground</hi>.</q>
Ex. 3:5. See also Joshua 5:15.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

of God made the place holy. Wherever God

<q>Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and
<hi rend='italic'>the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle</hi>.</q> Ex. 40:34. See 2
Chron. 5:13, 14.
</p>

<p>
6. Why should all show respect for the house of worship?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>The Lord is in His holy temple</hi>: let all the earth keep silence
before Him.</q> Hab. 2:20.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;A failure to recognize
this fact leads many to treat the house
of worship without due respect. Nothing seems more appropriate to
divine worship than that a sense of awe and silence should pervade the
place of worship, and that only the sound of prayer, praise, and thanksgiving
to God should be heard within its walls. Both upon entering and
just before leaving the house of God it is highly appropriate and a most
excellent practise for each worshiper to bow the head for a few moments
in silent prayer.
</quote>

<p>
7. How did Christ manifest His regard for the sanctity of
God's house?
</p>

<p>
<q>And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the
temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the
temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and
the seats of them that sold doves; and would not suffer that any
man should carry any vessel through the temple. And He
taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be
called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it
a den of thieves.</q> Mark 11:15-17.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This
cleansing occurred at the close of Christ's public ministry.
There was a similar cleansing also at the beginning of His ministry.
See John 2:13-17.
</quote>

<p>
8. What punishment did God bring upon Nadab and Abihu
for offering strange or common fire in the tabernacle service?
</p>

<p>
<q>And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of
them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon,
and offered strange fire before the Lord, which He commanded
them not. <hi rend='italic'>And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured
them, and they died before the Lord.</hi></q> Lev. 10:1, 2.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This, like
the two cleansings of the temple by Christ at the
beginning and close of His ministry (John 2:13-17; Matt. 21:12-16),
shows that God is particular in regard to the worship and conduct of the
worshipers in His house. No performance or exercise should be permitted
in any church or building especially dedicated to God's service which is
not in keeping with its sacred character, or conducive to reverence for God
and for holy things. It should not be made a place for feasting, visiting,
or worldly entertainment and amusement.

<p>
9. For what purpose are we exhorted to have grace?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved,
<pb n='620'/><anchor id='Pg620'/>
let us have grace, <hi rend='italic'>whereby we may serve God acceptably with
reverence and godly fear</hi>: for our God is a consuming fire.</q> Heb.

10. In what spirit did David say he would worship?
</p>

<p>
<q>But as for me, I will come into Thy house in the multitude
of Thy mercy: and <hi rend='italic'>in Thy fear will I worship toward Thy holy
temple</hi>.</q> Ps. 5:7.
</p>

<p>
11. What instruction has Solomon given respecting our conduct
in the house of God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and
be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they
consider not that they do evil.</q> Eccl. 5:1.
</p>

<p>
12. How extensively has God said He would be honored?
</p>

<p>
<q>For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down
of the same My name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in
every place incense shall be offered unto My name, and a pure
offering: for My name shall be great among the heathen, saith
the Lord of hosts.</q> Mal. 1:11.
</p>

<p>
13. For how many did God design that His house should
be a house of prayer?
</p>

<p>
<q>Even them [the sons of the stranger] will I bring to My
holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer:
their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon
Mine altar; for Mine house shall be called <hi rend='italic'>an house of prayer
for all people</hi>.</q> Isa. 56:7.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
fifty-sixth chapter of Isaiah contains a prophecy relating
to New Testament times. It is plain, therefore, that Christ enunciated
a general principle, applicable to all houses dedicated to God's service,
when, quoting this prophecy, He said that God's house should be a
house of prayer for all nations. See margin of Mark 11:17.
</quote>

<p>
14. Who is present in all assemblies met in Christ's name?

<p>
1. What was connected with the worship of God before the
first advent?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then verily the first covenant had also <hi rend='italic'>ordinances of divine
service</hi>, and a worldly sanctuary.</q> Heb. 9:1.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Paul
says that these ordinances consisted <q>in meats and
drinks, and divers washings,</q> imposed <q>until the time of reformation,</q>
and that they were <q>a shadow of good things to come.</q> Heb. 9:10; 10:1.
</quote>

<p>
2. To whom did the sacrificial offerings point forward?
</p>

<p>
<q>And walk in love, as <hi rend='italic'>Christ</hi>
also hath loved us, and <hi rend='italic'>hath
given Himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God</hi> for a sweet-smelling
savor.</q> Eph. 5:2.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Through the
provisions of the sacrificial law, the repentant
sinner showed his faith in the coming Redeemer, who was to shed His
blood for the sins of mankind. These sacrificial offerings were ordinances
which pointed forward to the work of Christ, which they typified. Since
the crucifixion, the ordinances of the Christian church point backward, and
are designed to show faith in the work of Christ already accomplished.
</quote>

<p>
3. What does the Lord desire us to keep in mind?
</p>

<p>
<q>By which also ye are saved, if ye <hi rend='italic'>keep in memory</hi> what I
preached unto you, ... <hi rend='italic'>how that Christ died for our sins</hi>
according to the Scriptures; and that He was <hi rend='italic'>buried</hi>, and that
He <hi rend='italic'>rose again</hi> the third day according to the Scriptures.</q>
1 Cor. 15:2-4.
</p>

<pb n='622'/><anchor id='Pg622'/>

<p>
4. What ordinance commemorates Christ's burial and resurrection?
</p>

<p>
<q>Buried with Him in <hi rend='italic'>baptism</hi>, wherein also ye are risen with
Him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised
Him from the dead.</q> Col. 2:12.
</p>

<p>
5. For what purpose was the Lord's Supper instituted?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>The Lord Jesus the same night in which He was betrayed
took bread</hi>: and when He had given thanks, He brake it, and said,
Take, eat: <hi rend='italic'>this is My body</hi>, which
is broken for you: <hi rend='italic'>this do in
remembrance of Me</hi>.</q> 1 Cor. 11:23, 24.
</p>

<p>
6. What is signified by the wine?
</p>

<p>
<q>In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This
cup is <hi rend='italic'>the new covenant in My blood</hi>: this do, as oft as ye drink
it, in remembrance of Me.</q> Verse 25, R. V.
</p>

<p>
7. What do both the bread and the wine commemorate?
</p>

<p>
<q>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
show <hi rend='italic'>the Lord's death</hi> till He come.</q> Verse 26.
</p>

<p>
8. What caution is given concerning engaging in this
ordinance unworthily?
</p>

<p>
<q>Whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the
Lord, unworthily, shall be <hi rend='italic'>guilty of the body and blood of the
Lord</hi>.... He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth
and drinketh damnation to himself, <hi rend='italic'>not discerning the Lord's
body</hi>.</q> Verses 27-29.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
last expression shows what is meant by eating and
drinking unworthily. It is not the one who has a deep sense of his sinfulness
and of his unworthiness of God's mercy and grace, but he who does
not discern that Christ died for his sins&mdash;who is not penitent&mdash;that eats
and drinks unworthily.
</quote>

<p>
9. What preparation should be made for this service?
</p>

<q>Let a man <hi rend='italic'>examine himself</hi>, and so let him eat of that bread,

the loud cymbals: praise Him upon the high-sounding cymbals.
Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the
Lord.</q> Psalm 150.

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;Music, like
poetry and flowers, is elevating and refining in
its nature, and should therefore have its place in the worship of God, and
in the life and experience of God's people. It is adapted to every mood and
feeling of the human soul, and many times has reached hearts when other
means have failed. Next to prayer, music seems best adapted to worship.
</p>

<p>
<q>The history of the songs of the Bible is full of suggestion as to
the uses and benefits of music and song. Music is often perverted to
serve purposes of evil, and it thus becomes one of the most alluring agencies
of temptation. But, rightly employed, it is a precious gift of God,
designed to uplift the thoughts to high and noble themes, to inspire and
elevate the soul. As the children of Israel, journeying through the wilderness,
cheered their way by the music of sacred song, so God bids His children
today gladden their pilgrim life. There are few means more effective
for fixing His words in the memory than repeating them in song. And
such song has wonderful power. It has power to subdue rude and uncultivated
natures; power to quicken thought and to awaken sympathy, to
promote harmony of action, and to banish the gloom and foreboding that
destroy courage and weaken effort.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>Education,</q>
pages 167, 168.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<q>O that we might sing evening and morning, and let song touch song
all the way through! O that we could put songs under our burden! O
that we could extract the sense of sorrow by song! Then sad things would
not poison so much. Sing in the house; teach your children to sing. When
troubles come, go at them with song. When griefs arise, sing them down.
Lift the voice of praise against cares. Praise God by singing; that will
lift you above trials of every sort. Attempt it. They sing in heaven,
and among God's people on earth song is the appropriate language of
Christian feeling.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Henry Ward Beecher.</hi>

    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
1. What example of giving has God given to the world?
</p>

<p>
<q>God so loved the world, that <hi rend='italic'>He gave His only begotten Son</hi>,
that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have
everlasting life.</q> John 3:16.
</p>

<p>
2. By what were Abraham's faith and devotion tested?
</p>

<p>
<q>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, <hi rend='italic'>offered up Isaac</hi>;
and he that had received the promises <hi rend='italic'>offered up his only begotten
son</hi>.</q> Heb. 11:17.
</p>

<p>
3. What did Christ do to redeem us?
</p>

<p>
<q>Who <hi rend='italic'>gave Himself</hi> for our sins.</q> Gal. 1:4. See also Titus
2:14; 1 Tim. 2:6.
</p>

<p>
4. Why did He lay aside His riches and become poor?
</p>

<p>
<q>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that,
though He was rich, yet <hi rend='italic'>for your sakes He became poor, that ye
through His poverty might be rich</hi>.</q> 2 Cor. 8:9.
</p>

<p>
5. After Abraham was blessed, what was he to be?
</p>

<p>
<q>I will bless thee, ... <hi rend='italic'>and thou shalt be a blessing</hi>.</q>
Gen. 12:2.
</p>

<pb n='630'/><anchor id='Pg630'/>

<p>
6. As Christ sent out His disciples to preach, to heal the
sick, and to raise the dead, what did He say to them?
</p>

<p>
<q>Freely ye have received, <hi rend='italic'>freely give</hi>.</q> Matt. 10:8.
</p>

<p>
7. Why does God comfort us in our troubles?
</p>

<p>
<q>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, <hi rend='italic'>that we may be
able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith
we ourselves are comforted of God</hi>.</q> 2 Cor. 1:4.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;All
who accept the gospel take upon themselves the obligation
to pass its blessings on to others. In this way the work of salvation
is extended. Every soul reclaimed from sin, God expects to join in the
same work for others which lifted him up, and placed his feet upon the
Rock. The good things of God are not to be selfishly kept to ourselves.
We receive to give. Says Whittier, <q>The soul is lost that's saved alone.</q>
And as love prompted God's great gift, so His love in our hearts will prompt
us to give, to minister, and to engage in loving service for the welfare and
the happiness of others.
</quote>

<p>
8. What did Christ say of the blessedness of giving?
</p>

<p>
<q>I have showed you all things, how that so laboring ye ought
to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord
Jesus, how He said, <hi rend='italic'>It is more blessed to give than to receive</hi>.</q>
Acts 20:35.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The government
of God is founded on the principle of benevolence,
or the desire to bless others. Our richest blessings come as the

9. For what was Christ anointed by the Holy Spirit?

<p>
<q>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me; because the Lord

<q>Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the
Gentiles, <hi rend='italic'>to take out of them a people for His name</hi>.</q>
Acts 15:14.
</p>

<p>
5. How are those who preach the gospel described?
</p>

<p>
<q>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that

tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion,
Thy God reigneth.</q> Isa. 52:7.

<p>
6. What was the object of Christ's ministry?
</p>

<p>
<q>I the Lord have called Thee in righteousness, and will
hold Thine hand, and will keep Thee, and give Thee for a covenant
of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; <hi rend='italic'>to open the blind
eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit
in darkness out of the prison-house</hi>.</q> Isa. 42:6, 7.
</p>

<p>
7. For what purpose did Christ select the apostle Paul, and
send him to the Gentiles?
</p>

<p>
<q>And He said, ... I have appeared unto thee for this
purpose, <hi rend='italic'>to make thee a minister and a witness ... to open
their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the
power of Satan unto God</hi>, that they may receive forgiveness of
sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith
that is in Me.</q> Acts 26:15-18.
</p>

<p>
8. What is the Christian minister commanded to preach?
</p>

<p>
<q>Preach <hi rend='italic'>the word</hi>.</q> 2 Tim. 4:2.
</p>

<p>
9. Of what did Christ say the Scriptures testify?
</p>

<p>
<q>They are they which testify of <hi rend='italic'>Me</hi>.</q> John 5:39.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Every
one, therefore, who preaches the word aright, will
preach Christ. Paul, who faithfully preached God's word, said he was
determined not to know (i.e., to make known) anything <q>save Jesus Christ,
and Him crucified.</q> 1 Cor. 2:2. Jonathan Edwards was once asked by
a young minister what he thought of a sermon he had just preached. <q>It
was a very poor sermon, indeed,</q> said Mr. Edwards. <q>Why?</q> asked the
young minister. <q>Because,</q> said Mr. Edwards, <q>there was no <emph>Christ</emph>
in it.</q> All the great truths of the Scriptures center in Christ. Rightly
understood, all lead to Him. Christ, therefore, should be presented in
every discourse as the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end, of the
great plan of salvation.

12. What rule for teaching doctrine is laid down in the Bible?

<pb n='633'/><anchor id='Pg633'/>

<p>
<q>For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept;
line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little.</q>
Isa. 28:10.
</p>

<p>
13. How should the servant of God labor?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle
unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those
that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance
to the acknowledging of the truth.</q> 2 Tim. 2:24, 25.

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;While the

</p>

<p>
20. For what does the Lord tell us to pray?

<q>All these men of war, that could <hi rend='italic'>keep rank</hi>, came with a
perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel.</q>
1 Chron. 12:38.
</p>

<p>
5. That the burden of judging and looking after the affairs
<pb n='655'/><anchor id='Pg655'/>
of Israel might not all rest on Moses, what instruction did Jethro,
his father-in-law, give him?
</p>

<p>
<q>Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men,
such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and
place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of
hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. And let them
judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great
matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they
shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear
the burden with thee.</q> Ex. 18:21, 22.
</p>

<p>
6. How many apostles did Christ at first ordain to preach
the gospel?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>He ordained twelve</hi>, that they should be with Him, and
that He might send them forth to preach.</q> Mark 3:14.
</p>

<p>
7. How many did He later appoint to this work?
</p>

<p>
<q>After these things the Lord appointed <hi rend='italic'>other seventy also</hi>,
and sent them two and two before His face into every city and
place, whither He Himself would come.</q> Luke 10:1.
</p>

<p>
8. When the number of the disciples multiplied, what instruction
did the apostles give the believers, that none might be
neglected in the daily ministration of temporal necessities?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of
honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we
may appoint over this business.</q> Acts 6:3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The men
thus selected were known as deacons. The lesson
to be learned from this is that leaders and people should unite in planning
and providing for the necessary organization and officering of the church
according to its growth and needs. This cooperation is again shown in the
words of Paul, <q>Whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will
I send.</q> 1 Cor. 16:3. See also Acts 15:22.
</quote>

<p>
9. What word came through the Spirit to the ministering
prophets and teachers laboring at Antioch?
</p>

<p>
<q>As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy
Ghost said, <hi rend='italic'>Separate Me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto
I have called them</hi>. And when they had fasted and prayed,
and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.</q> Acts
13:2, 3.
</p>

<p>
10. What is one of the gifts which God has set in the church?
</p>

<p>
<q>And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily
prophets, thirdly teachers, after that ... helps,
<hi rend='italic'>governments</hi>.</q> 1 Cor. 12:28.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

word here rendered <hi rend='italic'>governments</hi> implies the work or
office of <q>steering, piloting, directing.</q>

<p>
11. For the direction of matters in each local church, what
instruction did the apostle Paul give to Titus?
</p>

<p>
<q>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set
in order the things that are wanting, and <hi rend='italic'>ordain elders in every
city</hi>, as I had appointed thee.</q> Titus 1:5.
</p>

<p>
12. What instruction did he give to the members of the
church as to their relationship to those thus appointed?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Obey them that have the rule</hi>
[margin, <hi rend='italic'>guide</hi>] <hi rend='italic'>over you, and
submit yourselves</hi>: for they watch for your souls, as they that
must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with
grief.</q> Heb. 13:17. See 1 Peter 5:5; Mark 10:42-45.
</p>

<p>
13. What instruction and caution are given to elders?
</p>

<p>
<q>The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an
elder, ... <hi rend='italic'>Feed the flock of God</hi>
which is among you, <hi rend='italic'>taking
the oversight thereof</hi>, not by constraint, but willingly; not for
filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; <hi rend='italic'>neither as being lords over God's
heritage</hi>, but being ensamples to the flock.</q> 1 Peter 5:1-3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;For the
qualifications and duties of elders, see 1 Tim. 3:1-3;
Titus 1:6-9; Acts 20:28-31; and the scripture just quoted. How
God regards rebellion against divinely appointed authority and leadership,
is illustrated in the expulsion of Satan and his angels from heaven,
and in the fate of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. See Rev. 12:7-9; Numbers
16. The unity and harmony which should exist among believers is
described in John 13:34, 35; 17:20-23; and Eph. 4:1-6. The evil of
place-seeking in the church is shown in Mark 10:35-45 and Luke 14:7-11;
and of ecclesiastical tyranny, in Dan. 7:25; 8:24, 25; 2 Thess. 2:3,
4; and John 16:2. The course to be pursued toward offending members,
and in cases where differences arise, is pointed out in Matt. 18:15-18; 5:23,
24; Gal. 6:1; 1 Tim. 5:19, 20; Titus 3:10, 11; 1 Corinthians 5; and
Acts 15. And the guide-book in all matters of both doctrine and discipline
should be the Bible. Isa. 8:20; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; 4:1, 2.

    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
1. What is one way in which we are commanded to honor
God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Honor the Lord <hi rend='italic'>with thy substance</hi>,
and <hi rend='italic'>with the first-fruits
of all thine increase</hi>.</q> Prov. 3:9.
</p>

<p>
2. What part of one's income has the Lord especially claimed
as His?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>all the tithe</hi> [<hi rend='italic'>tenth</hi>]
<hi rend='italic'>of the land</hi>, whether of the seed of
the land, or of the fruit of the tree, <hi rend='italic'>is the Lord's: it is holy unto
the Lord</hi>.</q> Lev. 27:30.
</p>

<p>
3. For whose support and for what work was the tithe devoted
in Israel?
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, I have given <hi rend='italic'>the children of Levi</hi> all the tenth in
Israel for an inheritance, <hi rend='italic'>for their service which they serve, even
the service of the tabernacle of the congregation</hi>.</q> Num. 18:21.
</p>

<p>
4. In what language does Paul approve of the same method
of support for the gospel ministry?
</p>

<p>
<q>If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great
thing if we shall reap your carnal things?... Do ye not
know that they which minister about holy things live of the
things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers
with the altar? <hi rend='italic'>Even so hath the Lord ordained that they
<pb n='658'/><anchor id='Pg658'/>
which preach the gospel should live of the gospel</hi>.</q> 1 Cor. 9:11-14.
</p>

<p>
5. Upon what fundamental basis does the requirement of
tithe-paying rest?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>The earth is the Lord's</hi>, and the fulness thereof; the world,
and they that dwell therein.</q> Ps. 24:1.
</p>

<p>
6. Who owns all the gold and silver in the world?
</p>

<p>
<q>The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, saith the Lord of
hosts.</q> Haggai 2:8.
</p>

<p>
7. Who owns all the cattle and fowls of the earth?
</p>

<p>
<q>For every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon a
thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the
wild beasts of the field are Mine.</q> Ps. 50:10, 11.
</p>

<p>
8. Who gives man power to get wealth?
</p>

<p>
<q>But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for <hi rend='italic'>it is He
that giveth thee power to get wealth</hi>.</q> Deut. 8:18.
</p>

<p>
9. What statement of Christ shows that man is not an
original owner, but a steward of God's goods?
</p>

<p>
<q>For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far
country, who called his own servants, and <hi rend='italic'>delivered unto them
his goods</hi>.</q> Matt. 25:14. See 1 Cor. 4:7.
</p>

<p>
10. How early in the history of the world do we read of
tithe-paying?
</p>

<p>
<q>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most
high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of
the kings, and blessed him; to whom also <hi rend='italic'>Abraham gave a tenth
part of all</hi>.</q> Heb. 7:1, 2. See Gen. 14:17-20.
</p>

<p>
11. What vow did Jacob make at Bethel?
</p>

<p>
<q>And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me,
and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread
to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father's
house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: ... and
<hi rend='italic'>of all that Thou shalt give
me I will surely give the tenth unto Thee</hi>.</q>
Gen. 28:20-22.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;It is
thus evident that the duty of paying tithes was recognized
by the patriarchs as a religious obligation.
</quote>

<p>
12. After what order was Christ made a high priest?
</p>

<p>
<q>Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even <hi rend='italic'>Jesus, made
an high priest forever after the order of Melchisedec</hi>.</q> Heb. 6:20.
</p>

<pb n='659'/><anchor id='Pg659'/>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;As Christ's
priesthood succeeded the Aaronic or Levitical
priesthood, which was supported by the tithes of Israel; and as Christ
was made a priest after the order of Melchisedec, who received tithes
of the patriarchs before the Levitical priesthood was ordained, it is but
logical and natural to conclude that the ministry under Christ's priesthood
should be supported by the same means as were both of these priesthoods,&mdash;the
tithes of God's people.
</quote>

<p>
13. Did Christ Himself approve of tithe-paying?
</p>

<p>
<q>Ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have
omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and
faith: <hi rend='italic'>these ought ye to have done</hi>, and not to leave the other
undone.</q> Matt. 23:23.
</p>

<p>
14. Of what is one guilty who withholds the tithe and free-will
offerings?
</p>

<p>
<q>Will a man rob God? Yet <hi rend='italic'>ye have robbed Me</hi>. But ye
say, Wherein have we robbed Thee? <hi rend='italic'>In tithes and offerings.</hi></q>
Mal. 3:8.
</p>

<p>
15. Concerning what does the Lord ask us to prove Him,
and upon what conditions does He promise great blessings?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse</hi>, that there may
be meat in Mine house, and <hi rend='italic'>prove Me now herewith</hi>, saith the
Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven,
and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough
to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes,
and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall
your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the
Lord of hosts.</q> Verses 10, 11.

<p>
<q>It is <hi rend='italic'>more blessed to give than to receive</hi>.</q> Acts 20:35.

<p>
7. How does God regard the covetous man?

<p>
<q>The wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the

</p>

<pb n='662'/><anchor id='Pg662'/>

<p>
8. What warning did Christ give against covetousness?
</p>

<p>
<q>Take heed, and <hi rend='italic'>beware of covetousness</hi>: for a man's life
consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.</q>
Luke 12:15.
</p>

<p>
9. How, in the parable, did God regard the selfish rich man?
</p>

<p>
<q>But God said unto him, <hi rend='italic'>Thou fool</hi>, this night thy soul shall
be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which

<p>
10. What application does Christ make of this parable?
</p>

<p>
<q>So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not
rich toward God.</q> Verse 21. See 1 Tim. 6:7.
</p>

<p>
11. By what means can men lay up treasure in heaven?
</p>

<p>
<q>Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags

<hi rend='italic'>that they be rich in good works</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>ready to distribute</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>willing to communicate</hi>;
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation
against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal
life.</q> 1 Tim. 6:17-19.
</p>

<p>
13. How does God regard such a course?
</p>

<p>
<q>But to do good and to communicate forget not: <hi rend='italic'>for with
such sacrifices God is well pleased</hi>.</q> Heb 13:16.
</p>

</p>

<p>
1. What do the Scriptures say concerning hospitality?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Use hospitality one to another</hi> without grudging. As every
man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one
to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</q>
1 Peter 4:9, 10. <q>Be kindly affectioned one to another with
brotherly love; ... <hi rend='italic'>distributing to the necessity of saints;
given to hospitality</hi>.</q> Rom. 12:10-13.
</p>

<p>
2. Is a mere expression of good wishes sufficient?
</p>

<p>
<q>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed
and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which
are needful to the body; <hi rend='italic'>what doth it profit</hi>?</q> James 2:15, 16.

<p>
3. When should we exercise hospitality?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>As we have therefore opportunity</hi>, let us do good unto all
men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</q>
Gal. 6:10.

<p>
4. What encouragement is given to entertain strangers?
</p>

<p>
<q>Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for <hi rend='italic'>thereby some
have entertained angels unawares</hi>.</q> Heb. 13:2. See Gen 18:
1-8; 19:1-3.
</p>

<p>

<pb n='665'/><anchor id='Pg665'/>

<p>
<q>He riseth from supper, and laid aside His garments; and

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;From the
scriptures just cited, it appears that the usual
custom in Christ's time was for the guests to wash their own feet.
</p>

<p>
<q>As sandals were ineffectual against the dust and heat of an Eastern
climate, washing the feet on entering a house was an act both of respect
to the company and of refreshment to the
traveler.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Complete Dictionary
of the Bible, by Smith and Barnum, article <q>Washing the Hands and Feet.</q></hi>
</p>

<p>
At a feast it was an Oriental custom for servants or slaves to wash the
feet of guests. See 1 Sam. 25:40, 41. It was not the custom, however,
of <emph>equals</emph> to wash the feet of <emph>equals</emph>,
much less for <emph>superiors</emph> to wash the
feet of <emph>inferiors</emph>. But this is the very thing that Christ did when He
washed the disciples' feet, and instituted the ordinance of feet-washing.
In this lies the lesson of humility and willingness to serve which He designed
to teach.

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This
ordinance is a type of a higher cleansing,&mdash;the cleansing
of the heart from the stain of sin. It is a rebuke to all selfishness and
seeking of place and preferment among Christ's professed followers, and a
witness to the fact that, in God's sight, it is true humility and loving service
which constitute real greatness.

12. Learning that union with Christ depended on this service,
what did Peter say?

done to you.</q> Verse 15.
</p>

ought to wash one another's feet</hi>.</q> Verses 13, 14.
</p>

<p>
15. What did Christ say would be their experience in obeying
His instruction?
</p>

<p>
<q>If ye know these things, <hi rend='italic'>happy are ye if ye do them</hi>.</q>
Verse 17.
</p>

<p>
16. How does Christ regard an act performed toward the
humblest of His disciples?
</p>

<p>
<q>Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these
My brethren, <hi rend='italic'>ye have done it unto Me</hi>.</q> Matt. 25:40.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The great
lesson intended to be taught by the instituting of
this ordinance evidently was such humility as would lead to willing service
for others. The ordinance itself has been practised by many of the most
devout followers of Christ during the Christian era, and is still observed
by some. Kitto, in his Cyclopedia of Biblical Literature, says it became
<q>a part of the observances of the early Christian church,</q> and that <q>traces
of the practise abound in ecclesiastical history.</q> The Waldenses held it
as an ordinance of the church (see their <q>Confession of Faith,</q> page 12);
and according to the Cyclopedia of Biblical Literature (Vol. III, page
616), <q>the Church of England at first carried out the letter of the command.</q>
It is a great test of character, and its observance tends to unite
hearts in Christian fellowship and love.

31. What solemn warning is addressed to the rich who, in
the last days, have heaped up treasure, and oppressed the poor?
</p>

<p>
<q>Go to now, ye rich men, <hi rend='italic'>weep and howl for your miseries
that shall come upon you</hi>. Your riches are corrupted, and your
garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered;
and <hi rend='italic'>the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat
<pb n='677'/><anchor id='Pg677'/>
your flesh as it were fire</hi>. Ye have heaped treasure together for
the last days. Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped
down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth:
and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the
ears of the Lord of sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the
earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a
day of slaughter.</q> James 5:1-5.

Prov. 11:4.

<p>
33. What will the rich men do with their money then?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall
be removed</hi>: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver
them in the day of the wrath of the Lord: they shall not satisfy
their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumbling-block
of their iniquity.</q> Eze. 7:19.

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;When the steamer
<q>Central America,</q> with nearly six
hundred passengers aboard, was wrecked off Cape Hatteras, Sept. 12,
1857, in a fearful storm, many of the passengers who were returning miners
from the gold-mines of California, divested themselves of their treasure
belts and scattered the gold upon the cabin floors, telling those to take it
who would, lest its weight about their persons should carry them to their
death. <q>Full purses, containing in some instances thousands of dollars,
lay around untouched. Carpetbags were opened, and the shining metal
was poured out on the floor with the prodigality of death's despair. One
of the passengers opened a bag and dashed about the cabin twenty thousand
dollars in gold-dust, and told him who wanted to gratify his greed for gold
to take it. But it was passed by untouched, as the veriest
dross.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>Our

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Notes.</hi>&mdash;These
examples furnish good lessons on financing gospel
enterprises. In each instance, it will be noticed, the means were provided
before the work of building was begun. No debt, therefore, was created.
In all business transactions this plan is an excellent one to follow.
</p>

<p>
<q>Debt! There is no worse demoralizer of character. The sad
records of defaulting, embezzling, and dishonest failure which we meet
with so constantly in the daily press are often, indeed most frequently,
the result of the demoralization of debt, and the consequent desperate
efforts of extraction. The financial props have given way.... Debt
ruins as many households and destroys as many fine characters as rum;
it is the devil's mortgage on the soul, and he is always ready to foreclose.
Pay all your bills. Look every man in the face, conscious that you owe
the world no more than it owes you. Be indebted for nothing but love,
and even that be sure you pay in kind, and
that payments are frequent.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Talmage.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<q>This running into debt is a great cause of dishonesty....
Young men are growing quite shameless about being in debt; and the immorality
extends throughout society. Tastes are becoming more extravagant
and luxurious, without the corresponding increase of means to enable
them to be gratified. But they are gratified nevertheless; and debts are
incurred, which afterwards weigh like a millstone round the neck....
The safest plan is to run up no bills, and never get into debt; and the next is
if one does get into debt, to get out of it again as quickly as possible. A
man in debt is not his own master: he is at the mercy of the tradesman he
employs.... No man can be free who is in debt. The inevitable
effect of debt is not only to injure personal independence, but, in the long
run, to inflict moral degradation. The debtor is exposed to constant
humiliations.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'><q>Thrift,</q>
by Samuel Smiles, pages 243-247.</hi>
</p>

<p>
The following testimony on this subject is borne by a Chicago lady,
who had been happily wedded for fifty years. <q>I know why John and I
have been happy during these fifty years. In the first place, we have
made it a rule never to go in debt. I have lived in Chicago sixty-eight
years, and never during that time have I owed a person a cent....
I believe a good deal of unhappiness is caused by spending more than you
make. It has been our policy to buy what we could well afford to have,
and then stop.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Chicago Tribune, Aug. 24, 1902.</hi>

1. Of what has God made all nations?

<q>And hath made <hi rend='italic'>of one blood</hi> all nations of men for to dwell
on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before
appointed, and the bounds of their habitation.</q> Acts 17:26.
</p>

<p>
2. To how many is God good?
</p>

<p>
<q>The Lord is <hi rend='italic'>good to all</hi>: and His tender mercies are over all
His works.</q> Ps. 145:9.
</p>

<q>Neither doth God respect any person.</q> 2 Sam. 14:14.

Him</hi>.</q> Acts 10:34, 35.
</p>

<p>
5. What prohibitions are given in the Scriptures against
having respect of persons?
</p>

<p>
<q>Ye shall not respect persons <hi rend='italic'>in judgment</hi>; but ye shall hear
the <hi rend='italic'>small</hi> as well as
the <hi rend='italic'>great</hi>; ye shall not be afraid of the face of
man.</q> Deut. 1:17. <q>Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment:
thou shalt not respect the person of the <hi rend='italic'>poor</hi>, nor honor
<pb n='682'/><anchor id='Pg682'/>
the person of the <hi rend='italic'>mighty</hi>: but in righteousness shalt thou judge

... respecteth not the <hi rend='italic'>proud</hi>, nor such as turn aside to
<hi rend='italic'>lies</hi>.</q> Ps. 40:4.
</p>

<p>
6. Of what are those guilty who respect persons?
</p>

<p>
<q>If ye have respect to persons, <hi rend='italic'>ye commit sin</hi>, and are convinced
of the law as <hi rend='italic'>transgressors</hi>.</q> James 2:9. <q>He that
despiseth his neighbor <hi rend='italic'>sinneth</hi>.</q> Prov. 14:21.
</p>

<p>
7. By what illustration is this sin made plain?
</p>

<p>
<q>My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. For if there come
unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel,
and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; and ye have
respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him,
Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou
there, or sit here under my footstool: are ye not then partial
in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</q> James
2:1-4.
</p>

<p>
8. What led to the appointment of deacons in the early
Christian church?
</p>

<p>
<q>And in those days, when the number of the disciples was
multiplied, <hi rend='italic'>there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the
Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration</hi>.</q>
Acts 6:1.
</p>

<p>
9. What mistake did Peter and others make some years
later in their conduct?
</p>

<p>
<q>But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to
the face, because he was to be blamed. For before that certain
came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: <hi rend='italic'>but when they
were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which
were of the circumcision</hi>. And the other Jews dissembled likewise
with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away
with their dissimulation.</q> Gal. 2:11-13.
</p>

<p>
10. How are all national, unholy, and unjust distinctions
among men swept away in Christ?
</p>

<p>
<q>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have
put on Christ. <hi rend='italic'>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither
bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one
in Christ Jesus.</hi></q> Gal. 3:27, 28. See also Col. 3:11.

</p>

<p>
<q>Now the just shall live <hi rend='italic'>by faith</hi>.</q> Heb. 10:38.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;If men are <hi rend='italic'>justified</hi>
by faith, and are to <hi rend='italic'>live</hi> by faith, it follows
that to be unbelieving is not to be justified, and consequently not to live in
the sense here referred to.

<p>
5. In whom does the Lord have no pleasure?
</p>

<p>
<q>But if any man <hi rend='italic'>draw back</hi>, My soul shall have no pleasure
in him.</q> Same verse.
</p>

<pb n='688'/><anchor id='Pg688'/>

<p>
6. What kind of report did the ten spies bring back concerning
the promised land?
</p>

<p>
<q>They brought up <hi rend='italic'>an evil report</hi> of the land which they had
searched.</q> Num. 13:32.
</p>

<p>
7. What did Caleb say of the ability of Israel to take it?
</p>

<p>
<q>Let us go up at once, and possess it; for <hi rend='italic'>we are well able to
overcome it</hi>.</q> Verse 30.
</p>

<p>
8. What did the ten spies say?
</p>

<p>
<q>But the men that went up with him said, <hi rend='italic'>We be not able to
go up against the people; for they are stronger than we</hi>.</q> Verse 31.
</p>

<p>
9. Why did not Israel attain to the standard of righteousness?
</p>

<p>
<q>But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness,
hath not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore?
<hi rend='italic'>Because they sought it not by faith.</hi></q> Rom. 9:31, 32.
</p>

<p>
10. When told of the disciples' failure to heal an afflicted
son, what did Christ say of that generation?

hither thy hand, and thrust it into My side: and <hi rend='italic'>be not faithless,
but believing</hi>.</q> John 20:27.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The Lord
rebuked Thomas for his unbelief, because he would
not accept the testimony of so many credible witnesses who had seen Him.
How much more reprehensible is that unbelief which holds out against the
present <q>cloud of witnesses</q> of prophecy fulfilled and fulfilling!
</quote>

<p>
12. After speaking of the numerous examples of faith presented
in Hebrews 11, what does Paul exhort us to do?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so
great a cloud of witnesses, let us <hi rend='italic'>lay aside every weight, and the
sin which doth so easily beset us</hi>, and let us run with patience
the race that is set before us.</q> Heb. 12:1.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
<q>every weight</q> here spoken of includes those traits of
character and habits of life that retard or hinder our running successfully
the Christian race. These are to be laid aside. But there is one thing
referred to here that is more than a weight; it
is a <hi rend='italic'>sin</hi>, and one that easily
besets us all,&mdash;the sin of <hi rend='italic'>unbelief</hi>.
To be unbelieving, therefore, is sinful.

13. Why did many fail to enter into God's rest anciently?
</p>

<p>
<q>And to whom sware He that they should not enter into
His rest, but to them that <hi rend='italic'>believed
not</hi>? So we see that <hi rend='italic'>they
could not enter in because of unbelief</hi>.</q> Heb. 3:18, 19.
</p>

<p>
14. How are these unbelieving ones spoken of?
</p>

<p>
<q>But with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with
<hi rend='italic'>them that had sinned</hi>, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</q>
Verse 17.
</p>

<p>
15. What lesson should we learn from their course?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Let us therefore fear</hi>, lest, a promise being left us of entering
into His rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</q>
Heb. 4:1.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;God does
not change. If He was grieved at the unbelief
of the Israelites, and refused them admittance to Canaan in consequence,
He cannot permit us to enter the heavenly rest as long as we indulge in
unbelief.
</quote>

<p>
16. What should all labor to do?
</p>

<p>
19. When God made a promise to Abraham that seemed impossible
of fulfilment, how did the patriarch receive it?
</p>

<p>
<q>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief;
but was <hi rend='italic'>strong in faith</hi>, giving glory to God.</q> Rom. 4:20.
</p>

<p>
20. For what was Abraham's faith counted?
</p>

<p>
<q>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God,
and <hi rend='italic'>it was counted unto him for righteousness</hi>.</q> Verse 3.
</p>

<p>
21. When troubled with doubts, how should we pray?
</p>

</p>

<p>
22. What is promised those who believe when they pray?
</p>

them</hi>.</q> Mark 11:24.

how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote
out of thine eye: and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? Thou
hypocrite, <hi rend='italic'>first cast out the beam out of thine own eye</hi>; and then
shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's
eye.</q> Matt. 7:3-5.

<p>
5. What did Christ say He did not come to do?

<p>
<q>If any man hear My words, and believe not, I judge him
not: for <hi rend='italic'>I came not to judge the world</hi>, but to save the world.</q>
<q>For God sent not His Son into the world to <hi rend='italic'>condemn</hi> the world;
but that the world through Him might be <hi rend='italic'>saved</hi>.</q> John 12:47;

9. Instead of railing on His enemies, what did Christ do?

suffered, He threatened not; but <hi rend='italic'>committed Himself to Him that
judgeth righteously</hi>.</q> 1 Peter 2:23.
</p>

<p>
10. Wherein do man's judging and God's judging differ?
</p>

<p>
<q>For the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for <hi rend='italic'>man looketh on
the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart</hi>.</q> 1 Sam.
16:7. <q>Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but
<hi rend='italic'>God knoweth your hearts</hi>:
for <hi rend='italic'>that which is highly esteemed among
men is abomination in the sight of God</hi>.</q> Luke 16:15.
</p>

<p>
11. How does Christ tell us to judge?

the appearance</hi>, but <hi rend='italic'>judge righteous
judgment</hi>.</q> John 7:24.
</p>

<p>
12. How, by whom, and in what spirit should those having

<p>
<q>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, <hi rend='italic'>ye which are
spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering
thyself, lest thou also be tempted</hi>.</q> Gal. 6:1.
</p>

<p>
13. Of what are those generally guilty who judge others?
</p>

<p>
<q>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou
art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest
<pb n='692'/><anchor id='Pg692'/>
thyself; <hi rend='italic'>for thou that judgest doest the same things</hi>.</q>
Rom. 2:1.
</p>

<p>
14. Whom are we not likely to judge and condemn?
</p>

</p>

<p>
15. What instruction does James give regarding judging?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Speak not evil one of another, brethren.</hi> He that speaketh
evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the
law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art
not a doer of the law, but a judge.</q> James 4:11. See Titus 3:2.
</p>

<p>
16. Why is it safer not to judge and condemn others?
</p>

<p>
<q>Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye

ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it
shall be measured to you again.</hi></q> Matt. 7:2. See Ps. 18:25, 26.
</p>

<p>
17. To what time are we exhorted to defer judgment?

come</hi>, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness,
and will make manifest the counsels of the heart.</q> 1 Cor. 4:5.

<p>
<q>Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which
is <hi rend='italic'>hypocrisy</hi>.</q>
Luke 12:1.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Hypocrisy is a
feigning to be what one is not; dissimulation;
a concealment of one's real character or motives; especially, the assuming
of a false appearance of virtue or religion.

mother.... But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father
or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited
by me; and honor not his father or his mother, he shall be

4. How did Christ say hypocrites pray?
</p>

<p>
<q>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites

corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men</hi>. Verily I say
unto you, They have their reward.</q> Matt. 6:5.

others, but does not see nor correct his own?

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Thou hypocrite</hi>, first cast out the beam out of thine own
eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of
thy brother's eye.</q> Matt. 7:5.
</p>

<p>
6. How does a hypocrite treat his neighbor?
</p>

<p>
<q>An hypocrite with his mouth <hi rend='italic'>destroyeth his neighbor</hi>.</q>
<q>For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: <hi rend='italic'>Eat and drink, saith
he to thee; but his heart is not with thee</hi>.</q> Prov. 11:9; 23:7.
</p>

<p>
7. Which of the apostles was once guilty of dissimulation?

<p>
12. What is to be the fate of that servant who, while professing
to love the Lord, shows by his actions that he is worldly,
and is not looking nor longing for His coming?
</p>

<p>
<q>The Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh
not for Him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and
shall cut him asunder, and <hi rend='italic'>appoint
him his portion with the hypocrites</hi>:
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</q> Matt.

1. After creating man, what did God say?

<p>
<q>And the Lord God said, <hi rend='italic'>It is not good that the man should
be alone</hi>.</q> Gen. 2:18.
</p>

<p>
2. What, therefore, did God say He would make?
</p>

<p>
<q>I will make him <hi rend='italic'>an help</hi> meet for him.</q> Same verse.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Not a <hi rend='italic'>helpmeet</hi>
nor a <hi rend='italic'>helpmate</hi>, but&mdash;two words&mdash;a help
<hi rend='italic'>meet</hi> for him; that is, <hi rend='italic'>fit</hi> or
<hi rend='italic'>suitable</hi> for him. The word
<hi rend='italic'>meet</hi> in the original
means a front, a part opposite, a counterpart, or mate. Man's companion,
or help, was to correspond to him. Each was to be suited to the
other's needs.
</quote>

<p>
3. Could such a help be found among the creatures which
God had already made?
</p>

<p>
<q>And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the
air, and to every beast of the field; <hi rend='italic'>but for Adam there was not
found an help meet for him</hi>.</q> Verse 20.
</p>

<p>
4. What, therefore, did God do?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam,
and he slept: and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the
flesh instead thereof; and the rib, which the Lord God had taken
from man, <hi rend='italic'>made he a woman, and brought her unto the man</hi>.</q>
Verses 21, 22.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;How beautiful,
in its fulness of meaning, is this simple but
suggestive story, at which skeptics sneer. God did not make man after
the order of the lower animals, but <q>in His own image.</q> Neither did He
<pb n='706'/><anchor id='Pg706'/>
choose man's companion, or <q>help,</q> from some other order of beings, but
made her from man&mdash;of the same substance. And He took this substance,
not from man's <hi rend='italic'>feet</hi>, that
he might have an excuse to degrade, enslave, or
trample upon her; nor from man's <hi rend='italic'>head</hi>,
that woman might assume authority
over man; but from man's <hi rend='italic'>side</hi>,
from over his <hi rend='italic'>heart</hi>, the <hi rend='italic'>seat of affections</hi>,
that woman might stand at his side as <hi rend='italic'>man's
equal</hi>, and, <hi rend='italic'>side by side with
him</hi>, together, under God, work out the purpose and destiny of the race,&mdash;man,
the strong, the noble, the dignified; woman, the weaker, the sympathetic,
the loving. How much more exalted and inspiring is this view than
the theory that man developed from the lower order of animals.
</quote>

<p>
5. What did Adam say as he received his wife from God?
</p>

<p>
<q>And Adam said, <hi rend='italic'>This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of
my flesh</hi>: she shall be called <hi rend='italic'>Woman</hi>, because she was taken out
of <hi rend='italic'>Man</hi>.</q> Verse 23.
</p>

<p>
6. What great truth was then stated?
</p>

<p>
<q>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother,
and shall cleave unto his wife: and <hi rend='italic'>they shall be one flesh</hi>.</q>
Verse 24.
</p>

<p>
7. In what words does Christ recognize marriage as of God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. <hi rend='italic'>What
therefore God hath joined together</hi>, let not man put asunder.</q>
Matt. 19:6.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Thus was
the marriage institution ordained of God in Eden,
before man sinned. Like the Sabbath, it has come down to us with the
Edenic dews of divine blessing still upon it. It was ordained not only for
the purpose of peopling the earth and perpetuating the race, but to promote
social order and human happiness; to prevent irregular affection;
and, through well-regulated families, to transmit truth, purity, and holiness
from age to age. Around it cluster all the purest and truest joys of home
and the race. When the divine origin of marriage is recognized, and the
divine principles controlling it are obeyed, marriage is indeed a blessing;
but when these are disregarded, untold evils are sure to follow. That
which, rightly used, is of greatest blessing, when abused becomes the
greatest curse.
</quote>

<p>
8. By what commands has God guarded the marriage relation?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou shalt not commit adultery.</q> <q>Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's wife.</q> Ex. 20:14, 17.
</p>

<p>
9. What New Testament injunction is given respecting
marriage?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Let marriage be had in honor among all</hi>, and let the bed be
undefiled: for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.</q> Heb.
13:4, R. V.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;By many, marriage
is lightly regarded&mdash;is often made even
a subject of jest. Its divine origin, its great object, and its possibilities
<pb n='707'/><anchor id='Pg707'/>
and influences for good or evil are little thought of, and hence it is often
entered into with little idea of its responsibilities or its sacred obligations.
The marriage relationship is frequently used in the Scriptures as a symbol
of the relationship existing between God and His people. See Rom.
7:1-4; 2 Cor. 11:2; Hosea 2:19, 20; Rev. 19:7.
</quote>

<p>
10. After the fall, what sort of marriages were introduced
by men, which were productive of great evil?
</p>

<p>
<q>And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the
face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that
<hi rend='italic'>the sons of God saw the daughters of men</hi> that they were fair;
<hi rend='italic'>and they took them wives of all which they chose</hi>.</q> Gen. 6:1, 2.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Not
only was there plurality of wives, which in itself is an
evil, but the <q>sons of God,</q> descending from Seth, married the <q>daughters
of men,</q> the descendants from the idolatrous line of Cain, and thus corrupted
the seed, or church, of God itself. All the barriers against evil
thus being broken down, the whole race was soon corrupted, violence filled
the earth, and the flood followed.
</quote>

<p>
11. What restriction did God make respecting marriages
in Israel?
</p>

<p>
<q>Let them marry to whom they think best; <hi rend='italic'>only to the family
of the tribe of their father shall they marry</hi>.</q> Num. 36:6.
</p>

<p>
12. What prohibition did God give His chosen people against
intermarrying with the heathen nations about them, and why?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Neither shalt thou make marriages with them</hi>; thy daughter
thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou
take unto thy son. <hi rend='italic'>For they will turn away thy son from following
Me, that they may serve other gods</hi>: so will the anger of the
Lord be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.</q>
Deut. 7:3, 4.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Intermarriage
with the ungodly was the mistake made by
the professed people of God before the flood, and God did not wish Israel
to repeat that folly.
</quote>

<p>
13. What instruction is given in the New Testament regarding
marriage with unbelievers?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers</hi>: for what
fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what
communion hath light with darkness? and what concord hath

<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This
instruction forbids all compromising partnerships.
Marriage of believers with unbelievers has ever been a snare by which
Satan has captured many earnest souls who thought they could win the
unbelieving, but in most cases have themselves drifted away from the
<pb n='708'/><anchor id='Pg708'/>
moorings of faith into doubt, backsliding, and loss of religion. It was one
of Israel's constant dangers, against which God warned them repeatedly.
<q>Give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters
unto your sons, nor seek their peace [by such compromise] or their wealth
forever.</q> Ezra 9:12. See also Ex. 34:14-16; Judges 14:1-3; Ezra 9
and 10; and Neh. 13:23-27. Even Solomon fell before the influence of
heathen wives. Concerning him the inspired Word has left this melancholy
record: <q>His wives turned away his heart after other gods.</q> 1 Kings
11:4. No Christian can marry an unbeliever without running serious risk,
and placing himself upon the enemy's ground. The Scriptures do not
advocate separation after the union has been formed (see 1 Cor. 7:2-16),
but good sense should teach us that faith can best be maintained, and
domestic happiness best insured, where both husband and wife are believers,
and of the same faith. Both ministers and parents, therefore,
should warn the young against all improper marriages.

14. What instruction did Abraham give his servant Eliezer
when sending him to select a wife for his son Isaac?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou shalt take a wife for my son <hi rend='italic'>of my kindred, and of my
father's house</hi>.</q> Gen. 24:40.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This
passage indicates that in early Bible times parents
generally had more to do in the selection of life companions for their children
than they commonly have now. Young people who are wise will
seek the advice and counsel of their parents, and above all, will seek to
know the will of God, before entering upon this important relationship,
with its grave responsibilities and its momentous consequences.

16. What only does Christ recognize as proper ground for
dissolving the marriage relationship?

<p>
<q>Whosoever shall put away his wife, <hi rend='italic'>except it be for fornication</hi>,
and shall marry another, committeth adultery.</q> Matt.
19:9.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Civil
laws recognize other reasons as justifiable causes for
separation, such as extreme cruelty, habitual drunkenness, or other like
gross offenses; but only one offense, according to Christ, warrants the
complete annulment of the marriage tie.

9. Why should wives be in subjection to their husbands?
</p>

are not educated in the home, that they may comprehend the truth of God,
and are not trained to love justice and to do judgment. They should be
patiently instructed, that they may understand the laws that govern
them, and that they may know the springs of their actions. They are
to be brought into harmony with the laws of heaven, to cherish the truth
as it is in Jesus. In this way they may be fitted to join the society of the

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Timothy's father
was a Greek, and his mother a Jewess.
From a child he had been taught the Scriptures. The faith of his mother
and of his grandmother in the Word of God had early been implanted in
him through their faithful instruction. 2 Tim. 1:5. The piety which he
saw in his home life had a molding influence upon his own life. This, with
his knowledge of the Scriptures, qualified him to bear responsibilities and
to render faithful service later in the cause of Christ. His home instructors
had cooperated with God in preparing him for a life of usefulness.

must themselves reform. They must bring God into their homes, and
make His Word their counselor and guide. They must teach their children
the fear of God, and that His Word is the voice of God addressed to them,
and that it is to be implicitly obeyed. <q>In too many households prayer
is neglected.... If ever there was a time when every house should
be a house of prayer, it is now. Fathers and mothers should often lift
up their hearts to God in humble supplication for themselves and their

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;While this
precept refers directly to our earthly parents,
it also includes God, our Father in heaven; for in honoring them we honor
Him. To the child too young to know God, the earthly parent takes the
place of God. Learning to honor, respect, and obey his earthly parents
is the child's first and most important lesson in learning to honor, respect,
and obey God, his Heavenly Parent. Benjamin Franklin well said: <q>Let a
child's first lesson be obedience, and the second may be what thou wilt.</q>

<q>Harken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not

11. How did the Jewish leaders in the days of Christ, for the

</p>

<p>
<q>But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother,
<hi rend='italic'>It is a gift</hi>, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; and
honor not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have
ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</q>
Matt. 15:5, 6.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The word
translated <hi rend='italic'>gift</hi> in this text means a thing dedicated
to God, and therefore not to be used for any other purpose. In this way
the Jewish teachers, by their traditional law, taught children that by saying
that their property was thus dedicated to the temple or to religious
purposes, they were free from the obligation to honor and support their
parents, thus making void one of the commandments of God. This Christ
condemned.

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Disobedience
to parents is a marked characteristic of the
present generation. Never before was it so common or so wide-spread.
The root of the evil, however, lies not so much in the children as in the
parents. Many of the latter are disobedient to God, their Father in heaven,
and so have failed to bring up their children in the fear of God and in the
ways of righteousness. Bible instruction, lessons of faith, and prayer must
not be neglected in the home if we would see obedient, God-fearing children
growing up in the world.

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;One
Christian mother writes thus concerning the importance
of child training: <q>Children who are allowed to come up to manhood or
womanhood with the will undisciplined and the passions uncontrolled, will
generally in after-life pursue a course which God condemns. The neglect
of parents to properly discipline their children has been a fruitful source
of evil in many families. The youth have not been restrained as they
should have been. Parents have neglected to follow the directions of the
Word of God in this matter, and the children have taken the reins of government
into their own hands. The consequence has been that they have
generally succeeded in ruling their parents, instead of being under their
authority. False ideas and a foolish, misdirected affection have nurtured
traits which have made the children unlovely and unhappy, have embittered
the lives of the parents, and have extended their baleful influence
from generation to generation. Any child that is permitted to have his
own way will dishonor God and bring his father and mother to shame.</q>

13. Against what evil should fathers guard?
</p>

<p>
<q>Fathers, <hi rend='italic'>provoke not your children
to anger</hi>, lest they be discouraged.</q>
Col. 3:21.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Correction
should never be given in anger, for anger in the
parent stirs up anger in the child. It is well to pray with a child before
correcting him, and frequently mild but faithful instruction, admonition,
and prayer are all the training necessary,&mdash;are, in fact, the best training
that can be given. But in any case of perverseness, stubbornness, or wilful
disobedience, the correction, whatever it may be, should be persisted
in until the child yields submissively to the will and wishes of the parent.
It is best, generally, that correction should be done in private, as this tends
to preserve the self-respect of the child, a very important element in character
building. No correction nor training should be violent or abusive,
or given for the purpose of breaking the will of the child, but rather to
direct the will, bring it into proper subjection, and the child to a realizing
sense of what is right and duty.

</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The hiding
of Moses was at the time when Pharaoh, king of
Egypt, had issued a decree that every Hebrew male child should be killed
as soon as he was born, to prevent too rapid an increase of the Hebrews.
The second chapter of Exodus tells the story of the finding of Moses by the
king's daughter, and his being brought up by his own mother employed as
a nurse. She was a woman of faith, and her teaching of Moses was such
that after he had been at the Egyptian court till he <q>was come to years,</q>
he chose to suffer affliction with God's people rather than to enjoy the
honor of succeeding to the throne of Egypt as the adopted heir. He became
the leader of God's people when they escaped from the Egyptian
bondage, and after he died, he was raised to life and taken to heaven. See

are able to make thee wise unto salvation.</q> 2 Tim. 3:15.
</p>

<p>
13. How earnestly should parents teach their children the
things of God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou shalt teach them <hi rend='italic'>diligently</hi> unto thy children.</q> <q>Ye
shall teach them your children, speaking of them <hi rend='italic'>when thou sittest
in thine house</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>when
thou walkest by the way</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>when thou
liest down</hi>, and <hi rend='italic'>when thou risest up</hi>.</q> Deut. 6:7; 11:19.
</p>

<p>
14. What reward in this life is promised the faithful
mother?
</p>

<p>
<q>Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband
also, and he praiseth her.</q> Prov. 31:28.
</p>

<p>
15. What beautiful picture of home life is drawn by the
psalmist for the father who fears the Lord?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the side of thine
house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the
Lord.</q> Ps. 128:3, 4.
</p>

<p>
16. What motive will inspire all true parents to faithfulness
in teaching their children?
</p>

<p>
<q>That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth;
that our daughters may be as corner-stones, polished after the
similitude of a palace.</q> Ps. 144:12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;We often
hear the saying, <q>The hand that rocks the cradle
rules the world.</q> This is not out of keeping with the saying of the wise
man, <q>Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he
will not depart from it.</q> Prov. 22:6. No father or mother knows the
future of the little child prattling about the home circle. But God knows,
as He did in the cases of Moses and Esther and Timothy. Whether it is
His purpose for some of our children to rule the world, as did Joseph and
Daniel virtually, as prime ministers; or for some of them to <q>stand before
kings,</q> as did Moses and Esther and Daniel; or for some of them to serve
and suffer for the name of Christ, as did Peter and John and Paul, it is
our sacred privilege to teach the children faithfully and diligently during
their tender years.

    <head>The Burning Of Sodom.
"And Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain."
Gen. 13:12.</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
1. When Abraham told Lot to choose that part of the
country which he preferred, what choice did Lot make?
</p>

<p>
<q>And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of
Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere, before the Lord
destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord....
<hi rend='italic'>Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan.</hi></q> Gen. 13:10,
11.
</p>

<p>
2. Where did Lot dwell?
</p>

<p>
<q>Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and <hi rend='italic'>Lot dwelled in the
cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom</hi>.</q> Verse 12.
</p>

<p>
3. What was the character of the inhabitants of Sodom?
</p>

<p>
<q>But the men of Sodom were <hi rend='italic'>wicked and sinners before the
Lord exceedingly</hi>.</q> Verse 13.
</p>

<p>
4. What further description is given of this city?
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, <hi rend='italic'>pride</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>fulness of bread</hi>, and
<hi rend='italic'>abundance of idleness</hi> was in her and in her
daughters, <hi rend='italic'>neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and
needy</hi>. And they were <hi rend='italic'>haughty</hi>,
and <hi rend='italic'>committed abomination</hi>
before Me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.</q> Eze.
16:49, 50. See Gen. 19:1-9.
</p>

<p>
5. How did their conduct affect Lot?
</p>

<p>
<q>And delivered just Lot, <hi rend='italic'>vexed with the filthy conversation of
<pb n='732'/><anchor id='Pg732'/>
the wicked</hi>: (for that righteous man dwelling among them, in
seeing and hearing, <hi rend='italic'>vexed his righteous soul from day to day with
their unlawful deeds</hi>).</q> 2 Peter 2:7, 8.
</p>

<p>
6. Before destroying Sodom and Gomorrah, whom did the
Lord send to deliver Lot and his family?
</p>

<p>
<q>And there came <hi rend='italic'>two angels</hi> to Sodom at even....
And the men [angels] said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides?
son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever
thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: for we will
destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before
the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.</q>
Gen. 19:1-13.
</p>

<p>
7. What did Lot do, and how were his efforts rewarded?
</p>

<p>
<q>And Lot went out, and <hi rend='italic'>spake unto his sons-in-law</hi>, which
married his daughters, and said, <hi rend='italic'>Up, get you out of this place</hi>;
for the Lord will destroy this city. <hi rend='italic'>But he seemed as one that
mocked unto his sons-in-law.</hi></q> Verse 14.
</p>

<p>
8. What did the angels say to Lot the next morning?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here</hi>;
lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city....
<hi rend='italic'>Escape for thy life; look not behind thee</hi>, neither stay thou in
all the plain; <hi rend='italic'>escape to the mountain</hi>, lest thou be consumed.</q>
Verses 15-17.
</p>

<p>
9. What then took place?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah
brimstone and fire</hi> from the Lord out of heaven; and He overthrew
those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the
cities, and that which grew upon the ground.</q> Verses 24, 25.
</p>

<p>
10. Because she disregarded the instruction given by the
angels, what became of Lot's wife?
</p>

<p>
<q>But his wife looked back from behind him, and <hi rend='italic'>she became
a pillar of salt</hi>.</q> Verse 26.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;As a
result of choosing a city life, Lot lost nearly all his family.
</quote>

<p>
11. Foretelling the condition of the world previous to His
second advent, to what did Christ liken it?
</p>

<p>
<q>Likewise also <hi rend='italic'>as it was in the days of Lot</hi>; they did eat, they
drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but
the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone
from heaven, and destroyed them all. <hi rend='italic'>Even thus shall it
be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</hi></q> Luke 17:28-30.
</p>

<pb n='733'/><anchor id='Pg733'/>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The cities
of today are fast becoming like Sodom and Gomorrah&mdash;centers
and sink-holes of vice, pride, violence, confusion, and crime.
The cities of the United States, while containing only about one half the
population of the country, furnish ninety-seven per cent of the crime. Out
of 268 boys in the Kansas State Reform School a few years ago, all but
three came from cities. In New York City a murder is committed every
thirty-six hours. The numerous holidays, the whirl of excitement, pleasure,
and sports, theatergoing, horse-racing, gambling, liquor drinking, and reveling
in the cities, attract thousands from the sober duties of life, and stimulate
every evil passion to activity. What a poor place, therefore, are the
cities of today in which to rear a family! Too many, like Lot, have pitched
their tent toward Sodom.
</quote>

<p>
12. Of what is the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah a
type?
</p>

<p>
<q>And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes
condemned them with an overthrow, <hi rend='italic'>making them an ensample
unto those that after should live ungodly</hi>.</q> 2 Peter 2:6.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The destruction
of such cities as Sodom and Gomorrah,
Babylon and Jerusalem, is set forth as a type of the destruction awaiting
the world. Says one writer: <q>The time is near when the large cities will
be visited by the judgments of God. In a little while these cities will be
terribly shaken. No matter how large or strong their buildings, no matter
how many safeguards against fire may have been provided, let God touch
these buildings and in a few minutes or in a few hours they will be in ruins.
The ungodly cities of our world are to be swept away by the besom of
destruction. In the calamities that are now befalling immense buildings
and large portions of the cities, God is showing us what will come upon
the whole earth.</q> The destruction of the great cities now almost wholly
given up to sinful pleasure, pride, mammon-worship, and idolatry, is impending.
It is time, therefore, that those who are really in earnest concerning
their children's salvation begin to think about leaving these cities.

<p>
13. What is to take place under the seventh plague?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air;
... and there was <hi rend='italic'>a great earthquake</hi>, such as was not since
men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so
great.... <hi rend='italic'>And the cities of the nations fell.</hi></q> Rev. 16:17-19.

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
greatest foes to social purity are immoral associates,
impure literature, improper dress, idleness, intemperance, and theater-going,
including questionable picture shows, all of which are confined
almost exclusively to city life. For this reason parents should look well
to their children's home life; their companions; the books, papers, and
magazines they read; how their time is occupied; what they eat, drink,
and wear; where they spend their nights; and the character of their amusements.
<q>Pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness</q> were contributing
causes to the gross immorality of Sodom, and its consequent
downfall. Eze. 16:49, 50.

</p>

<p>
6. Why should the health of the body be preserved?
</p>

<p>

own?</q> Verse 19.

<p>
8. What will God do to those who defile this temple?
</p>

<p>
<q>If any man defile the temple of God, <hi rend='italic'>him shall God destroy</hi>;
for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</q> 1 Cor.
3:17.
</p>

<p>
9. What example did Daniel set in this matter?
</p>

<p>
<q>But Daniel purposed in his heart <hi rend='italic'>that he would not defile

which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed</hi>; to you it shall be for
meat.</q> Gen. 1:29.
</p>

<p>
12. Why did the Lord restrict the Hebrews in their diet?
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
1. Concerning what did Paul reason before Felix?
</p>

<p>
<q>He reasoned of righteousness, <hi rend='italic'>temperance</hi>, and judgment
to come.</q> Acts 24:25.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Temperance means
habitual moderation and control in the
indulgence of the appetites and passions; in other words, self-control.
</quote>

<p>
2. Of what is temperance a fruit?
</p>

<p>
<q>But <hi rend='italic'>the fruit of the Spirit</hi> is love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, <hi rend='italic'>temperance</hi>.</q> Gal. 5:22,
23.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;<q>Temperance
puts wood on the fire, meal in the barrel,
flour in the tub, money in the purse, credit in the country, contentment
in the house, clothes on the back, and vigor in
the body.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Benjamin
Franklin.</hi>
</quote>

<p>
3. Where in Christian growth and experience is temperance
placed by the apostle Peter?
</p>

<p>
<q>Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and
to knowledge <hi rend='italic'>temperance</hi>; and to temperance patience; and to
patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to
brotherly kindness charity.</q> 2 Peter 1:5-7. See page <ref target='Pg542'>542</ref>.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Temperance is
rightly placed here as to order. Knowledge
is a prerequisite to temperance, and temperance to patience. It is very
difficult for an intemperate person to be patient.
</quote>

<p>
4. What is said of those who strive for the mastery?
</p>

<pb n='742'/><anchor id='Pg742'/>

<p>
<q>And every man that striveth for the mastery is <hi rend='italic'>temperate
in all things</hi>.</q> 1 Cor. 9:25.
</p>

<p>
5. In running the Christian race, what did Paul say he did?
</p>

<p>
<q>But <hi rend='italic'>I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection</hi>: lest
that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself
should be a castaway.</q> Verse 27.
</p>

<p>
6. Why are kings and rulers admonished to be temperate?
</p>

<p>
<q>It is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong
drink: lest they drink, and <hi rend='italic'>forget the law, and pervert the judgment
of any of the afflicted</hi>.</q> Prov. 31:4, 5.
</p>

<p>
7. Why were priests forbidden to use intoxicating drink
while engaged in the sanctuary service?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Lord spake unto Aaron, saying, Do not drink wine
nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into
the tabernacle: ... <hi rend='italic'>that ye may put difference between holy
and unholy, and between unclean and clean</hi>.</q> Lev. 10:8-10.
</p>

<p>
8. Why is indulgence in strong drink dangerous?
</p>

<p>
<q>And be not drunk with wine, <hi rend='italic'>wherein is excess</hi>; but be
filled with the Spirit.</q> Eph. 5:18.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
danger in the indulgence of stimulating foods and drinks
is that they create an unnatural appetite and thirst, thus leading to excess.
Both food and drink should be nourishing and non-stimulating.
</quote>

<p>
9. For what should men eat and drink?
</p>

<p>
<q>Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles,
and thy princes eat in due season, <hi rend='italic'>for strength</hi>, and not for
drunkenness!</q> Eccl. 10:17.
</p>

<p>
10. Why did Daniel refuse the food and wine of the king?
</p>

<p>
<q>But Daniel purposed in his heart <hi rend='italic'>that he would not defile
himself</hi> with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine
which he drank.</q> Dan. 1:8. See Judges 13:4.
</p>

<p>
11. Instead of these, what did he request?
</p>

<p>
<q>Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them
give us <hi rend='italic'>pulse to eat</hi>, and
<hi rend='italic'>water to drink</hi>.</q> Verse 12.
</p>

<p>
12. At the end of the ten days' test, how did he and his companions
appear?
</p>

<p>
<q>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared
<hi rend='italic'>fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the
portion of the king's meat</hi>.</q> Verse 15.
</p>

<p>
13. At the end of their three years' course in the school of
<pb n='743'/><anchor id='Pg743'/>
Babylon, how did the wisdom of Daniel and his companions
compare with that of others?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now at the end of the days ... the king communed
with them; <hi rend='italic'>and among them all was found none like Daniel,
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah</hi>: ... and in all matters
of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them,
<hi rend='italic'>he found them ten times better</hi>
than all the magicians and astrologers
that were in all his realm.</q> Verses 18-20.
</p>

<p>
14. What warning is given against leading others into intemperance?
</p>

<p>
<q>Woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink, that puttest
thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken.</q> Hab. 2:15.
</p>

<p>
15. What kind of professed Christians are not fellowshiped?
</p>

<p>
<q>But now I have written unto you not to keep company,
if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous,
or an idolater, or a railer, or a <hi rend='italic'>drunkard</hi>.</q> 1 Cor. 5:11.
</p>

<p>
16. Can drunkards enter the kingdom of God?
</p>

<p>
<q>Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, ... nor thieves,
nor covetous, nor <hi rend='italic'>drunkards</hi>, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall
inherit the kingdom of God.</q> 1 Cor. 6:9, 10. See Rev. 21:27.
</p>

<p>
17. For what perfection of character did the apostle pray?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray
God <hi rend='italic'>your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless</hi>
unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</q> 1 Thess. 5:23.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;For
notable examples of total abstinence in the Bible, see the
wife of Manoah, the mother of Samson (Judges 13:4, 12-14); Hannah,
the mother of Samuel (1 Sam. 1:15); the Rechabites (Jer. 35:1-10);
and John the Baptist (Luke 1:13-15).

<p>
1. What do the Scriptures say of wine?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wine is a <hi rend='italic'>mocker</hi>, strong drink
is <hi rend='italic'>raging</hi>: and whosoever
is <hi rend='italic'>deceived</hi> thereby is not wise.</q> Prov. 20:1.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;All
intoxicating drinks are deceptive. They seem to give
strength, but in reality cause weakness; they seem to create heat, but in
fact lower the general temperature; they seem to impart vitality, but
really destroy life; they seem to promote happiness, but cause the greatest
unhappiness and misery. To intemperance may be attributed much of
the world's sorrow.

<p>
2. What is one of the evil results of intemperance?
</p>

<p>
<q>Be not among wine-bibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:

<q>Who hath <hi rend='italic'>woe</hi>? who hath

Alcohol tends to destroy the higher forms of cells, those directly concerned
with the vital processes, particularly the delicate brain-cells, and
to replace them with useless and harmful connective tissue, or what is
commonly known as scar tissue. Reliable statistics demonstrate that the
total abstainer has an advantage of at least twenty-one per cent over the
moderate drinker.

</p>

<p>
<q>Cigarette smoking in the case of boys partly paralyzes the nerve
cells at the base of the brain, and this interferes with the breathing and
heart action. The end organs of the motor nerves lose their excitability,
next the trunks of the nerves, and then the spinal cord.... The
power of fine coordination is decidedly
lost.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Prof. Sims Woodhead, of
Cambridge University.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<q>The use of cigarettes affects the nervous system, weakens the will-power,
and destroys the ability of the boy to resist temptation; and because
of this he easily falls a victim of those habits which not only destroy
the mind and soul, but irresistibly lead him into a violation of the laws
of the state.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>George Torrance,
superintendent Illinois State Reformatory.</hi>
</p>

<p>
Tobacco using is demoralizing in its general effects, and tends to
create an appetite for strong drink. It originated with the natives of
North America, the Indians. In November, 1492, when Columbus
discovered the island of Cuba, he sent two sailors to explore it, who,
when they returned, reported, among many other strange and curious
discoveries, that the natives carried with them lighted firebrands, and
puffed smoke from their mouths and noses, which they supposed to be
the way the savages had of perfuming themselves. They afterward
declared that they <q>saw the naked savages twist large leaves together,
and smoke like devils.</q> Originating with the wild barbarians of America,
the smoking habit, after some years, was introduced into Europe, and
was rapidly adopted, not only by the lower classes, but by those in high
authority, even princes and nobles participating in the new intoxication.
It has since become well-nigh universal.

<p>
9. Where does intemperance often begin?
</p>

<p>
Intemperance often begins in the home. Many who would
not think of placing on their tables wine or liquor of any kind
will load them with food that creates a thirst for strong drink,&mdash;with
strong tea and coffee, injurious condiments, rich pastry,
highly seasoned foods, and the like.
</p>

<p>
10. What will drunkards, with other workers of iniquity,
never inherit?
</p>

<p>
"Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, ... nor thieves,
nor covetous, nor <hi rend='italic'>drunkards</hi>, ... shall
inherit <hi rend='italic'>the kingdom
of God</hi>." 1 Cor. 6:9, 10.

The total consumption of alcoholic liquors in the United States for
forty-two years (1870-1911) was 43,611,000,564 gallons.
</p>

<p>
The drink bill of the United States for 1911 was estimated at $1,833,653,425,
or nearly twice the national debt.
</p>

<p>
The number of liquor dealers in the United States in 1910 was 255,765,
or over a quarter of a million.
</p>

<p>
The capital invested in the manufacture of liquor in the United
States in 1850 was less than $10,000,000. In 1910, sixty years later,
it had increased to over $770,000,000, or more than 7,700 per cent.
</p>

<p>
The total internal revenue received by the United States for liquor
for forty-nine years, or from 1863 to 1911, was $5,245,916,047.01.

<p>
The use of whisky, beer, cigars, and cigarettes in the United States
increased enormously in 1912. During the three months of July, August,
and September of this year alone, 33,150,000 gallons of whisky were used,
an increase of 450,000 gallons over the corresponding period of the previous
year; 19,800,000 barrels of beer were drunk, an increase of 320,000 barrels
over the same months of 1911; 1,950,000,000 cigars were smoked, a record
consumption; and more than 3,800,000,000 cigarettes were consumed, an

1. What was the original food provided for man?
</p>

<p>
<q>And God said, Behold, I have given you every <hi rend='italic'>herb</hi> bearing
<hi rend='italic'>seed</hi>, which is upon the face
of all the earth, and every <hi rend='italic'>tree</hi>, in
the which is <hi rend='italic'>the fruit of
a tree</hi> yielding <hi rend='italic'>seed</hi>; to you it shall be for
meat.</q> Gen. 1:29.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In other
words, vegetables, grains, fruits, and nuts.
</quote>

<p>
2. After the flood what other food was indicated as permissible?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Every moving thing that liveth</hi> shall be meat for you; even as
the green herb have I given you all things.</q> Gen. 9:3.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;From this
it is evident that flesh food was not included in the
original diet provided for man, but that on account of the changed conditions
resulting from the fall and the flood, its use was permitted.
</quote>

<p>
3. When God chose Israel for His people, what kinds of flesh
food were excluded from their diet?
</p>

<p>
Those called unclean. See Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy
14.
</p>

<p>
4. What special food did God provide for the children of
Israel during their forty years' wandering in the wilderness?
</p>

<pb n='756'/><anchor id='Pg756'/>

<p>
<q>Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain <hi rend='italic'>bread
from heaven</hi> for you.</q> <q>And the children of Israel did eat
<hi rend='italic'>manna</hi> forty years, until they came to a land inhabited.</q> Ex.
16:4, 35.
</p>

<p>
5. At the same time what did God promise to do for them?
</p>

<p>
<q>I will take <hi rend='italic'>sickness</hi> away from the midst of thee.</q> Ex.
23:25.
</p>

<p>
6. What testimony does the psalmist bear regarding their
physical condition?
</p>

<p>
<q>There was not one feeble person among their tribes.</q>
Ps. 105:37.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;When
they complained at God's dealings with them, and
longed for the food of Egypt, God gave them their desires, but sent <q>leanness
into their soul.</q> See Numbers 11; Ps. 106:13-15; 1 Cor. 10:6.
Like many today, they were not content with a simple but wholesome
and nourishing diet.
</quote>

<p>
7. Where, above all, should true temperance reform begin?
</p>

<p>
In the home.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Unless
fathers and mothers practise temperance, they cannot
expect their children to do so.
</quote>

<p>
8. What classes of men especially should be strictly temperate?
</p>

<p>
<q>Be thou an <hi rend='italic'>example</hi> of the believers.</q>  1 Tim. 4:12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;Of all men
in the world, ministers and physicians should lead
strictly temperate lives. The welfare of society demands this of them,
for their influence is constantly telling for or against moral reform and
the improvement of society. By precept and example they can do much
toward bringing about the much-needed reform.
</quote>

<p>
9. Can the fact that the liquor traffic brings in a large revenue
to the state justify men in licensing it?
</p>

<p>
<q>Woe to him that buildeth a town with <hi rend='italic'>blood</hi>, and stablisheth
a city by <hi rend='italic'>iniquity</hi>.</q> Hab. 2:12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In
all the walks and relationships of life, whether in the
home, the medical profession, the pulpit, or the legislative assembly,
men should stand for temperance. To license the liquor traffic is to
legalize and foster it. It cannot exist nor thrive without the patronage
of each rising generation, a large number of whom it must necessarily
ruin, body, soul, and spirit. For the state to receive money from such
a source, therefore, must be highly reprehensible. The practise has fittingly
been likened to a father catching sharks, and baiting his hook with
his own children.

<q>This day is salvation come to this house, <hi rend='italic'>forsomuch as he

15. What did He say to the woman of Samaria as to the
source of salvation?

<p>
<q>Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship:
for <hi rend='italic'>salvation is of the Jews</hi>.</q> John 4:22.
</p>

<p>
16. When the Jews rejected Paul's preaching of the gospel,
what did he and Barnabas say?
</p>

<p>
<q>Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was
necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken
to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy
of everlasting life, <hi rend='italic'>lo, we turn to the Gentiles</hi>.</q> Acts
13:46.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;From all
this it is plain that had not the Jews as a nation
rejected Christ, they would still have maintained the preeminence as
the children of God, and as God's light-bearers to the world. But on
account of this rejection, they were rejected as God's peculiar people,
and others took their place, and now bear
the name of <hi rend='italic'>Israel</hi> in common
with those who were first called by that name.

<p>
17. Under what figure are the Gentile believers represented
who have become a part of the true Israel of God?

<p>
<q>And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou,
being <hi rend='italic'>a wild olive-tree</hi>, wert grafted in among them, and with
them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive-tree; boast
not against the branches.</q> Rom. 11:17, 18.
</p>

<p>
18. Lest the Gentile grafts should boast, saying that the
Jews were broken off to let them come in, what warning is
given them?
</p>

<p>
<q>Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou
standest by faith. <hi rend='italic'>Be not high-minded, but fear</hi>: for if God
spared not the natural branches, <hi rend='italic'>take heed lest He also spare
not thee</hi>.</q> Verses 20, 21.
</p>

<p>
19. What encouragement is held out concerning the branches
which have been broken off?

<q>And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, <hi rend='italic'>shall be

</p>

<p>
<q>And so <hi rend='italic'>all Israel shall be saved</hi>.</q> Verse 26.

<p>
21. Before Gentiles become Israelites, in what condition
are they?
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles,
... at that time ye were <hi rend='italic'>without Christ, being aliens from
the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants
of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world</hi>.</q> Eph.
2:11, 12.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;If, in
order to be saved, Gentiles must become Israelites
as is everywhere asserted, then when converted from their Gentile ways
to the ways of Israel, they certainly must have faith in Christ, and their
lives must conform to the moral law which God gave to Israel, otherwise
it would not be the commonwealth of Israel, but of the Gentiles. The
writing of the law in the heart is one of the provisions of the new covenant
with true Israel. See Jer. 31:31-34; Heb. 8:8-12.

<p>
22. How are God's remnant people described?
</p>

<p>
<q>Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that <hi rend='italic'>keep
the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus</hi>.</q> Rev. 14:12.
</p>

<p>
23. Whose names are in the foundations of the holy city?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in
them <hi rend='italic'>the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb</hi>.</q> Rev. 21:14.
</p>

<p>
24. Whose names are on the twelve gates of the city?
</p>

<p>
<q>And [the wall] had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve
angels, and names written thereon, which are <hi rend='italic'>the names of the
twelve tribes of the children of Israel</hi>.</q> Verse 12.
</p>

<p>
25. Who will walk in the light of the city?
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend='italic'>the nations of them which are saved</hi> shall walk in the
light of it: and <hi rend='italic'>the kings of the earth</hi> do bring their glory and
honor into it.</q> Verse 24.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;This
city, the New Jerusalem, will be for all the nations
of the saved; and yet all who enter therein will enter through gates on
which are written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, from which it
is evident that all who are saved will belong to Israel. The name Israel
will be perpetuated in the new earth state, and very appropriately so,
because of its meaning. All who share in that future home of the saved
will be overcomers&mdash;princes and prevailers with God. See Rev. 3:12;
21:7. Christ recognized this division of the saved into twelve nations,
in selecting His apostles. He chose twelve. He recognized it again
when to the twelve He said: <q>Ye which have followed Me, in the regeneration
when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory, ye also shall
sit upon <emph>twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel</emph>.</q>
Matt. 19:28. And the apostles, after Christ's resurrection and ascension, themselves
recognized it, when, to fill the place of Judas, who fell, they appointed
another, in order to preserve the proper number, twelve.

</p>

<p>
<q>And this is the promise that He hath promised us, even
<hi rend='italic'>eternal life</hi>.</q> 1 John 2:25.
</p>

<p>
2. How may we obtain eternal life?
</p>

<p>
<q>For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten
Son, <hi rend='italic'>that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish,
but have everlasting life</hi>.</q> John 3:16.

<q>I give unto them <hi rend='italic'>eternal life</hi>; and they shall never perish.</q>

<pb n='771'/><anchor id='Pg771'/>

<p>
7. Why, after the fall, was man shut away from the tree

</p>

<p>
<q>Lest he put forth his hand, and <hi rend='italic'>take also of the tree of life,
and eat, and live forever</hi>.</q> Gen. 3:22.
</p>

<p>
8. What has Christ promised the overcomer?
</p>

<p>
<q>To him that overcometh will I give <hi rend='italic'>to eat of the tree of life</hi>,
which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</q> Rev. 2:7.
</p>

<p>
9. To what is the life of the redeemed compared?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>as the days of a tree</hi> are the days of My people, and
Mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</q> Isa.
65:22.
</p>

<p>
10. When will immortality be conferred upon the saints?
</p>

<p>
<q>We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,
and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption,
and this mortal must put on immortality.</q> 1 Cor.
15:51-53.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;In
accepting Christ the believer receives <q>that eternal life,
which was with the Father,</q> and this eternal life he retains as long as Christ
dwells in the heart by faith. This wondrous gift may be lost by failure to
maintain the faith which holds Christ fast. At the resurrection, immortality
is conferred upon those who have fallen asleep in Christ, and thus the
possession of eternal life becomes a permanent experience.

1. For what purpose was the earth created?

Himself that formed the earth and made it; He hath established
it, He created it not in vain, <hi rend='italic'>He formed it to be inhabited</hi>.</q>
Isa. 45:18.

</p>

<p>
10. Where are the righteous to be recompensed?

</p>

<p>
11. What will be the difference between the portion of
the righteous and the wicked?

<q>Wait on the Lord, and keep His way, and <hi rend='italic'>He shall exalt
thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt
see it</hi>.</q> Ps. 37:34.
</p>

<p>
12. What promise was made to Abraham concerning the
land?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated
from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the
place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward,
and westward: for <hi rend='italic'>all the land which thou seest, to thee will I
give it, and to thy</hi> <hi rend='smallcaps'>seed</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>forever</hi>.</q> Gen. 13:14, 15.
</p>

<p>
13. How much did this promise comprehend?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world</hi>, was
not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through
the righteousness of faith.</q> Rom. 4:13.
</p>

<p>
14. How much of the land of Canaan did Abraham own
in his lifetime?
</p>

<pb n='774'/><anchor id='Pg774'/>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>And He gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much
as to set his foot on</hi>: yet He promised that He would give it to
him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he
had no child.</q> Acts 7:5. See Heb. 11:13.
</p>

<p>
15. How much of the promised possession did Abraham
expect during his lifetime?
</p>

<p>
<q>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into
a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed;
and he went out, not knowing whither he went. By faith
<hi rend='italic'>he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country</hi>,
dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with
him of the same promise: <hi rend='italic'>for he looked for a city which hath
foundations, whose builder and maker is God</hi>.</q> Heb. 11:8-10.
</p>

<p>
16. Who is the seed to whom this promise was made?
</p>

<p>
<q>Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.
He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, <hi rend='italic'>And to
thy seed, which is Christ</hi>.</q> Gal. 3:16.
</p>

<p>
17. Who are heirs of the promise?

<q>And <hi rend='italic'>if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs
according to the promise</hi>.</q> Verse 29.
</p>

<p>
18. Why did not these ancient worthies receive the promise?
</p>

<p>
<q>And these all, having obtained a good report through
faith, received not the promise: God having provided some
better thing for us, <hi rend='italic'>that
they without us should not be made perfect</hi>.</q>
Heb. 11:39, 40.
</p>

<p>
19. What is to become of our earth in the day of the Lord?
</p>

<p>
<q>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night;
in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,
and <hi rend='italic'>the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and
the works that are therein shall be burned up</hi>.</q> 2 Peter 3:10.
</p>

<p>
20. What will follow this great conflagration?
</p>

<p>
<q>Nevertheless we, according to His promise, <hi rend='italic'>look for new
heavens and a new earth</hi>, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</q>
Verse 13.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;As
shown in the reading on <q>The Millennium,</q> page <ref target='Pg355'>355</ref>,
at the coming of Christ, the living wicked will die, and the saints will be
taken to heaven to dwell with Christ a thousand years, or until the wicked
of all ages are judged, and the time comes for their destruction and the
purification of the earth by the fires of the last day. Following this, the
earth will be formed anew, and man, redeemed from sin, will be restored
to his original dominion.

23. What will the saints do in the new earth?
</p>

<p>
<q>And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they

not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another
eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of My people,

</p>

26. What seasons of worship will be observed in the new

1. What was one of Christ's parting promises to His disciples?
</p>

<p>
<q>In My Father's house are many mansions: if it were not
so, I would have told you. <hi rend='italic'>I go to prepare a place for you.</hi></q>
John 14:2.
</p>

wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for <hi rend='italic'>He
hath prepared for them a city</hi>.</q> Heb. 11:16.

<p>
3. Where is this city, and what is it called?
</p>

<p>
<q>But <hi rend='italic'>Jerusalem which is above</hi> is free, which is the mother
of us all.</q> Gal. 4:26.
</p>

<p>
4. For what did Abraham look?
</p>

<p>
<q>For <hi rend='italic'>he looked for a city</hi> which hath foundations, whose
builder and maker is God.</q> Heb. 11:10.
</p>

<p>
5. What assurance has God given to believers?

7. How many foundations has this city?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the wall of the city had <hi rend='italic'>twelve foundations</hi>, and in
them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</q> Verse 14.
</p>

<p>
8. What is the measurement of the city?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large
as the breadth: and <hi rend='italic'>he measured the city with the reed, twelve
thousand furlongs</hi>.</q> Verse 16.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The
measure around it, as the words length and breadth,
imply, and as was the early custom of measuring cities, is 12,000 furlongs.
This is equal to 1,500 miles, 375 miles on each side, making a perfect
square. The area of this city is therefore 140,625 square miles, or 90,000,000
acres, or 3,920,400,000,000 square feet. Allowing 100 square feet
to each person, or a space ten feet square, the city would hold 39,204,000,000
persons, or twenty-six times the present population of the globe.

<p>
9. What is the height of the wall?
</p>

was pure gold, like unto clear glass.</q> Verse 18.
</p>

<p>
11. With what are the twelve foundations adorned?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished
with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was
<hi rend='italic'>jasper</hi>; the second, <hi rend='italic'>sapphire</hi>;
the third, a <hi rend='italic'>chalcedony</hi>; the fourth,
an <hi rend='italic'>emerald</hi>; the fifth,

glass.</q> Verse 21.
</p>

<p>
15. Why will this city have no need of the sun or moon?
</p>

<p>
<q>And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon,
<pb n='781'/><anchor id='Pg781'/>
to shine in it: <hi rend='italic'>for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb
is the light thereof</hi>. And the nations of them which are saved
shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring
their glory and honor into it.</q> Verses 23, 24. See Rev.
22:5; Isa. 60:19, 20.
</p>

<p>
16. Why are its gates not to be closed?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Blessed are they that do His commandments</hi>, that they may
have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates
into the city.</q> Rev. 22:14.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The late
English and American revisions render this, <q>Blessed
are they that wash their robes,</q> etc. The result is the same, for those who
wash their robes cease to sin, and hence do God's commandments.

<p>
19. When this city becomes the metropolis of the new earth,
what will be the condition of God's people?
</p>

<p>
<q>And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and
there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed
away.</q> Rev. 21:4.
</p>

<p>
20. What will flow through the city?

<p>
<q>And he showed me <hi rend='italic'>a pure river of water of life</hi>, clear as
crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</q>
Rev. 22:1.
</p>

<p>
21. What stands on either side of the river?
</p>

<p>
<q>In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the
river, was there <hi rend='italic'>the tree of Life</hi>, which bare twelve manner of
fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of
the tree were for the healing of the nations.</q> Verse 2.
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>Note.</hi>&mdash;The tree
of life which Adam lost through transgression is to
be restored by Christ. Access to this is one of the promises to the overcomer.
Rev. 2:7. Its bearing twelve kinds of fruit, a new kind each
month, suggests a reason why in the new earth <q>from one <emph>new moon</emph> to
another,</q> as well as <q>from one Sabbath to another,</q> all flesh is to come
before God to worship, as stated in Isa. 66:22, 23.

<p>
22. What will be the privilege of those who enter there?
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>And they shall see His face.</hi></q> Rev. 22:3, 4. See Matt.
5:8; Heb. 12:14; 1 Cor. 13:12.

<head>The Game Of Life In Progress</head>

    <head>The Struggle.
"We wrestle ... against the rulers of the
darkness of this world." Eph. 6:12.</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
In these three beautiful pictures illustrating the game of
life, Satan, the prince of darkness, is represented as playing
with man for his soul.
</p>

<p>
The scene chosen is a wide vault, whose arch is embellished
with lizard-shaped monsters, which adhere closely to the two
pillars, down which they seem to creep. On the left-hand side
of the picture, near Satan, is an open-mouthed lion ready to
devour his victim at the first opportunity.
</p>

<p>
The upper surface of a sarcophagus is transformed into a
chess-board, beside which man sits, his head resting on his
hand, and his countenance full of careful thought as to what
moves he should make next.
</p>

<p>
Opposite him is Satan, seated, his chin resting on his hand,
his hair and beard bristling wildly, and every feature expressive
of cunning intent, and a determination to watch every move,
take advantage of every mistake, and win if possible.
</p>

<p>
Beneath the arch, in the background, stands a lovely angel
form unnoticed by either of the players, but watching intently
the progress of the game.

<head>The Game Of Life Lost</head>

<p rend='text-align: center'>
  <figure url='images/illus788.png' rend='width: 80%'>
    <head>The Defeat.
"What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole
world, and lose his own soul?" Mark 8:36.</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
Here we see the results of the game lost. Satan has been
victorious. With a wild and horrid leer and a deathlike grip
he has seized his victim, and in triumph points to the sure but
gruesome signs of death,&mdash;the skulls and cross-bones. Amidst
smoke and flame, the hand of Death rises to strike man with
his poisoned dart.
</p>

<p>
In sadness and despair man sits, with covered face, and
weeps over his defeat. His hope is gone; he knows no peace;
he feels the icy clasp of his conquering foe. With keen regret,
he now ponders over his loss of faith, his neglect of prayer, and
his failure to study and follow his Guide-book. Life, with its
opportunities for gaining the life to come, has been wasted; and
now, when too late to make amends, he sees his fatal moves and
his great mistakes.
</p>

<p>
The figures on the wall have changed their visage, and seem
ready to pounce upon the doomed and helpless man. The
lion also has become more fierce, and thirsts for his blood, while
the angel turns in sadness from the scene and weeps.
</p>

<p>
The entire view is one of inexpressible sorrow and regret.

<head>The Game Of Life Won</head>

  <figure url='images/illus789.png' rend='width: 80%'>
    <head>The Victory.
"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I
have kept the faith." 2 Tim. 4:7.</head>
    <figDesc>Illustration.</figDesc>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
In the closing scene of this allegorical representation of man's
conflict with the powers of darkness, we have pictured the
happy issue of a faithful Christian life.
</p>

<p>
Satan has been defeated, and has departed.
</p>

<p>
The sleeping lion, the open Word, the cross and crown, all
speak of victory.
</p>

<p>
Instead of sitting in sorrow and mourning over defeat, the
man, with cheerful looks and thankful heart, lifts his eyes toward
heaven, and rejoices that he has met and vanquished his
deadly foe.
</p>

<p>
In the place of the ugly monsters on the wall, cherubs are
seen, with laurel wreaths ready to place upon the victor's brow,
while the angel, with joyful satisfaction, points the victor to his
exceeding great reward.
</p>

<p>
This is the game which all, whether conscious of the fact
or not, are playing. What its outcome will be in each case
depends upon how each one meets and fights life's battle day
by day. All may be victors if they will.
</p>

<p>
<q>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the
issues of life.</q> Prov. 4:23.
