<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Bible contains proof in itself of its divine origin. No
other book can answer the questionings of the mind or satisfy
the longings of the heart as does the Bible. It is adapted to
every age and condition of life, and is full of that knowledge
which enlightens the mind and sanctifies the soul.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the Bible we have a revelation of the living God. Received
by faith, it has power to transform the life. During
all its history a divine watch-care has been over it, and preserved
it for the world.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the flood, as men became numerous, and darkness was
again settling over the world, holy men wrote as they were
moved by the Spirit of God. Thus God spoke to His people,
and through them to the world, that a knowledge of God and
of His will might not perish from the earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For centuries this work went on, until Christ, the promised
Seed, came. With Him, and the blessed message of light and
salvation proclaimed by Him and by His apostles, the Scripture
record closed, and the Word of God was complete.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Old Testament Scriptures were first written in Hebrew,
upon scrolls, or rolls of parchment, linen, or papyrus. These
were later translated into Greek, the oldest translation being
known as the Septuagint, or <span class="tei tei-q">“Version of the Seventy,”</span> made at
Alexandria, for the Alexandrian Library, by a company of
seventy learned Jews, under the patronage of Ptolemy Philadelphus,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
about 285 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> The original order for this translation
is said to have been given by Alexander the Great, who previously,
upon visiting Jerusalem in 332 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, had learned from
the prophecy of Daniel that Grecia was to overthrow the Persian
kingdom. See Josephus's <span class="tei tei-q">“Antiquities of the Jews,”</span> book 11,
chap. 8, par. 5. This was the version in common use in the
time of Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The New Testament was all originally written in Greek,
except Matthew, which was first written in Hebrew, and later
translated into Greek.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At an early date, Latin translations, both of the Septuagint
and of the Greek New Testament, were made by different
individuals, and the more carefully prepared Latin Vulgate of
Jerome, the Bible complete, was made <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 383-405.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Printing, however, being yet unknown, copies of the Bible
could be produced only by the slow, laborious, and expensive
process of handwriting. This necessarily greatly limited its
circulation. Worse still, its illuminating and saving truths
were largely hidden for centuries by the errors, superstitions,
and apostasy of the dark ages. During this time the common
people knew little of its contents.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But with the invention of the art of printing about the middle
of the fifteenth century, and with the dawn of the great Reformation
in the century following, the Bible entered upon a new
era, preparatory to the final proclamation of the gospel throughout
the world.

Not a little significant is the fact that the first book printed
from movable type was the Bible in Latin, which came from the
press of John Gutenberg, at Mentz, Germany, in 1456, a copy
of which, in 1911, was sold in New York City for fifty thousand
dollars, the highest price ever paid for a single book.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus far, however, the Bible had been published only in
ancient tongues, now little understood by the common people.
Without the Word of God in their hands, the good seed sown
among them was easily destroyed. <span class="tei tei-q">“O,”</span> said the advocates
of its pure teachings, <span class="tei tei-q">“if the people only had the Word of God
in their own language, this would not happen! Without this
it will be impossible to establish the laity in the truth.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And why should they not have it in their own tongue? they
reasoned. Moses wrote in the language of the people of his
time; the prophets spoke in the tongue familiar to the men whom
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they addressed; and the New Testament was written in the language
then current throughout the Roman world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The translation of the Bible into English by John Wyclif,
in 1380, was the chief event in the beginning of the Reformation.
It also prepared the way for the revival of Christianity
in England, and the multiplying there of the Word by the millions,
for all the world, that has followed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To make such a translation at that time, says Neander,
<span class="tei tei-q">“required a bold spirit which no danger could appal.”</span> For
making it Wyclif was attacked from various quarters, because,
it was claimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“he was introducing among the multitude a
book reserved exclusively for the use of the priests.”</span> In the
general denunciation it was declared that <span class="tei tei-q">“thus was the gospel
by him laid more open to the laity, and to women who could
read, than it had formerly been to the most learned of the clergy;
and in this way the gospel pearl is cast abroad, and trodden
underfoot of swine.”</span> In the preface to his translation, Wyclif
exhorted all the people to read the Scriptures.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A sense of awe and a thrill of joy filled the heart of the great
German Reformer, when, at the age of twenty, while examining
the volumes in the library of the university of Erfurt, he held
in his hands, for the first time in his life, a complete copy of the
Bible. <span class="tei tei-q">“O God,”</span> he murmured, <span class="tei tei-q">“could I but have one of these
books, I would ask no other treasure.”</span> A little later he found
in a convent a chained Bible. To this he had constant recourse.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But all these Bibles here, as elsewhere, save in England,
were in an ancient tongue, and could be read only by the educated.
Why, thought Luther, should the living Word be confined
to dead languages? Like Wyclif, therefore, he resolved
to give his countrymen the Bible in their own tongue. This he
did, the New Testament in 1522, and the Bible complete, the
crowning work of his life, in 1534.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Impressed with the idea that the people should read the
Scriptures in their mother tongue, William Tyndale, likewise,
in 1525, gave to the English his translation of the New Testament,
and later, of portions of the Old Testament Scriptures.
His ardent desire that they should know the Bible was well
expressed in the statement that if God spared his life he would
cause the boy that drives the plow to know more of the Scriptures
than was commonly known by the divines of his day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first complete printed English Bible was that of Miles
Coverdale, printed at Zurich, Switzerland, in 1535. Matthew's
Bible, Taverner's Bible, and The Great Bible prepared at the
suggestion of Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, appeared soon
after. Thus the light of truth began to shine forth once more;
but not without opposition.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes under King
Zedekiah showed their contempt for God by burning the writings
of Jeremiah, and confining the prophet in a dungeon (Jer.
36:20-23; 38:1-6), so now men sought to stem the rising tide
of reform by burning the Bible and its translators.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Bible burning was inaugurated in England by the destruction
of copies of the Antwerp edition of Tyndale's New Testament,
at St. Paul's Cross, London, in 1527, followed by the burning
of a second edition in 1530. A little later there were wholesale
burnings of the writings and translations of Wyclif, Tyndale,
Basil, Barnes, Coverdale, and others.

Forty-three years after the death of Wyclif, or in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1428,
by order of the Council of Constance his bones were dug up and
burned. Oct. 6, 1536, by order of Charles V of Germany, Tyndale
was strangled and burned at the stake at Vilvorde, near
Brussels. <span class="tei tei-q">“If Luther will not retract,”</span> wrote Henry VIII of

In his <span class="tei tei-q">“Stories From English History,”</span>
pages 196, 197, Henry P. Warren
says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Henry, by Cromwell's advice,
ordered a translation of the Bible
to be made in English, and a copy to
be placed in every church. There had
been English translations before, but
they had not been in the hands of the
people generally, and had only been
read secretly and in fear.... Cromwell
then appointed Cranmer and the
bishops to revise the Bible, and publish
it without note or comment; and
in the year 1539 a copy of the English
Bible was chained to the reading-desk
of every parish church. From that
time the Bible has never ceased to be
printed and sold freely.”</span>

Says Charles C. Coffin, in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Story
of Liberty,”</span> page 44: <span class="tei tei-q">“The people listen
to the reading with wonder and delight.
They begin to think; and when
men begin to think, they take a step
toward freedom. They see that the
Bible gives them rights which hitherto
have been denied them,—the right to
read, to acquire knowledge. Schools are started. Men and
women who till now have not known a letter of the alphabet,
learn to read; children teach their parents. It is the beginning
of a new life, a new order of things in the community—the
beginning of liberty.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Bible is God's great text-book for man. It is His
lamp to our feet and light to our path in this world of sin. The
value of Bible study cannot therefore be overestimated.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Considered from a literary standpoint alone, the Bible
stands preeminent. Its terse, chaste style; its beautiful and
impressive imagery; its interesting stories and well-told narratives;
its deep wisdom and its sound logic; its dignified language
and its elevated themes, all make it worthy of universal
reading and careful study.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As an educating power, the Bible has no equal. Nothing
so broadens the vision, strengthens the mind, elevates the
thoughts, and ennobles the affections as does the study of the
sublime and stupendous truths of revelation. A knowledge of
its principles is an essential preparation to every calling. To
the extent that it is studied and its teachings are received, it
gives strength of character, noble ambition, keenness of perception,
and sound judgment. Of all the books ever written,
none contains lessons so instructive, precepts so pure, or promises
so great as the Bible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is nothing that so convinces the mind of the inspiration
of the Bible as does the reading of the Bible itself, and
especially those portions known as the prophecies. After the
resurrection of Christ, when everything else seemed to have
failed to convince the disciples that He had risen from the dead,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He appealed to the inspired Word, and <span class="tei tei-q">“expounded unto
them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself”</span>
(Luke 24:25-27), and they believed. On another occasion He
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they
be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.”</span> Luke 16:31.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As a guide, the Bible is without a rival. It gives a calm
peace in believing, and a firm hope of the future. It solves
the great problem of life and destiny, and inspires to a life of
purity, patience, and well-doing. It fills the heart with love
for God and a desire to do good to others, and thus prepares
for usefulness here and for a home in heaven. It teaches the
value of the soul, by revealing the price that has been paid to
redeem it. It makes known the only antidote for sin, and
presents the only perfect code of morals ever given. It tells
of the future and the preparation necessary to meet it. It
makes us bold for the right, and sustains the soul in adversity
and affliction. It lights up the dark valley of death, and
points to a life unending. It leads to God, and to Christ, whom
to know is life eternal. In short, it is the one book to live by
and die by.

days and the days of his children (Deut. 17:18-20), so ought
men now to study the Bible, and from it learn that fear which
is the beginning of wisdom, and that knowledge which is unto
salvation. As an aid and incentive to this, <span class="tei tei-q">“Bible Readings

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Briefly stated, a Bible reading consists of questions asked
concerning some subject, and answers to them from the Bible.
In other words, Bible readings mean a topical study of the
Bible by means of questions and answers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In either receiving or imparting knowledge, there is nothing
like the interrogation-point. Nothing so readily quickens
thought or awakens interest as a question. Children would
learn little if they asked no questions, and he would indeed be
a poor teacher who asked and answered none.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Knowing the value of this means of awakening thought,
arousing interest, and imparting information, God, in His wisdom,
inspired those who wrote the Bible to ask many questions,
that He might set us to thinking and studying about the great
themes with which it deals. See Job 38:4, 7; 14:14; Ps. 8:4;
Mal. 3:1, 2, 8; Ex. 32:26; 1 Chron. 29:5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But God not only asks questions; He answers them. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
following may be cited as a few short Bible readings, taken,
both questions and answers, directly from the Bible itself:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days,
that he may see good?</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking
guile. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue
it.”</span> Ps. 34:12-14.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions?
who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath
redness of eyes?</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek
mixed wine.”</span> Prov. 23:29, 30.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall
stand in His holy place?</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath
not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. He
shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness
from the God of his salvation.”</span> Ps. 24:3-5. See also Psalm
15 and Isa. 33:14-17.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Bible itself, therefore, sets the example of giving instruction
and of imparting most valuable information by means
of asking questions and answering them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The readings in this book as originally prepared were contributed
by a large number of Bible workers, whose experience
in giving Bible readings had taught them the most effective
methods of presenting the different subjects treated. Over one
million two hundred and fifty thousand copies of the book as
thus prepared have been sold.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The work has recently been thoroughly revised and rewritten,
much enlarged, entirely reillustrated, with the readings
classified and carefully arranged according to topics, by a
large committee of able critics and Bible students. So extensive
has been the revision, and so much and valuable the new
matter added, that the present work is practically a new book,
although retaining the same name and the same general plan
as the former work. Thus prepared, it is once more sent forth
on its mission of light and blessing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As a help in enabling the reader quickly to discover the
words which most directly answer the question asked, they are
generally printed in italic, unless the entire scripture quoted is
required for the purpose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Bible Readings”</span> will be found an excellent aid to private,
family, and public study of the Word of God.

it is to justify it; and the moment it is justified it ceases to be sin. All sin
is a manifestation of selfishness in some form, and its results are the opposite
of those prompted by love. The experiment of sin will result finally
in its utter abandonment and banishment forever, by all created intelligences,

evolution, which rests upon human research rather than upon divine
revelation, and which substitutes an impersonal force for a personal Creator,
overthrows the very foundation of the gospel. Redemption is simply
the new creation, and the Creator is the Redeemer. The Head of the
original creation is the Head of the new creation. The original creation
was wrought through Christ by the power of the word; the new creation,
or redemption, is wrought in exactly the same way. The evolutionary
theory of creation inevitably involves an evolutionary theory of the gospel,
and sets aside the truth concerning sin, the atoning sacrifice of Christ,
and the necessity of becoming new creatures through faith in the saving
power of Christ.

very confident that the Lord hath more truth and light yet to break forth
out of His Holy Word. For my part, I cannot sufficiently bewail the condition
of the Reformed churches, who are come to a period in religion, and
will go no farther than the instruments of their reformation. The Lutherans
cannot be drawn to go any farther than what Luther saw; and the
Calvinists, you see, stick fast where they were left by that great man of
God, who yet saw not all things. This is a misery much to be lamented;

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">Note.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—Christ's early life
is a pattern for all children and youth. It
was marked by respect and love for His mother. He was obedient to
His parents, and kind to all. He hated sin, and to every temptation turned
a deaf ear. He sought to understand the reason of things, and so increased
in knowledge and wisdom. He was sympathetic and tender-hearted, and
ever ready to relieve the oppressed, the sorrowing, and the suffering. If we
love Christ, we shall love to talk of Him; our sweetest thoughts will be of
Him; and by beholding Him we shall be changed into the same image.

difficult to understand, but which had long been hidden or obscured by
sin, apostasy, and tradition,—in such a way that the spiritually minded
and those desirous of learning the truth, might understand them, and the
worldly-minded and unwilling would not. When asked the meaning of
any parable, Christ readily explained it to His disciples. See Luke 8:9-15;

this, and therefore made constant use of this method of instruction.

the display of divine or superhuman power in

Christ fed the five thousand with the multiplied loaves and fishes,

the multiplied fruits of the earth, and no one marvels. Christ, by a
shortened process, changed water into wine, and everybody was astonished;
but every year God does this in the usual way—through the vine—in
almost limitless quantities, and no one is astonished. A divine miracle,
therefore, whenever performed, is wrought to heal and to save, and
to call attention to the source of divine power.

a personal connection with God, although surrounded by spiritual declension

In the case of the seed which is sown in the field, this same principle is
illustrated by the union of the reproducing power with the material form.
As the seed is thus capable of multiplying itself, so Christ reproduces His
own character in believers, by making them partakers of the divine nature.
At His coming He bestows upon the subjects of the kingdom the gift of
immortality (1 Cor. 15:51-53), and so the kingdom will stand forever.
It is quite likely that the wise men of Babylon did not understand about
the incarnation of God in the flesh in the coming Messiah, but in their
statement that the dwelling of the gods was not with flesh they announced
the fundamental error of Babylon, both ancient and modern, and really
denied the vital principle of Christianity. This was the essential secret,

Although the ten commandments, the law of God, are found in the
Roman Catholic versions of the Scriptures, as they were originally given,
yet the faithful are instructed from the catechisms of the church, and not
directly from the Bible. As it appears in these, the law of God has been
changed and virtually reenacted by the Papacy. Furthermore, communicants
not only receive the law from the church, but they deal with the
church concerning any alleged infractions of that law, and when they have
satisfied the ecclesiastical authorities, the whole matter is settled.

was the year of the Reign of Terror in the French Revolution, and the
year when the Roman Catholic religion was set aside in France and the
worship of reason was established in its stead. As a direct result of the
revolt against papal authority in the French Revolution, the French army,
under Berthier, entered Rome, and the Pope was taken prisoner Feb. 10,
1798, dying in exile at Valence, France, the following year. This period,
1793-1798, during which this death-stroke was inflicted upon the Papacy,
fittingly and clearly marks the close of the long prophetic period mentioned
in this prophecy. Any standard history of the time may be consulted in

interpretation already given to this vision shows plainly
that the power represented by the little horn is the successor of Medo-Persia
and Grecia. In the vision of the seventh chapter of Daniel, which
is closely related to this vision, the fourth beast represented the fourth
kingdom, or Rome, in its entirety, special attention, however, being given
to the </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">little horn</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> phase of its history. As shown by the work attributed
to it, this little horn, which arose among the ten kingdoms into which Rome
was divided, was to be a religio-political power, which was to change the
times and law of God, and persecute the people of God. In the vision of
the eighth chapter the ecclesiastical features of this fourth world power are
especially noticed and emphasized, and hence the only symbol there used
to represent it is the </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">little horn</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> which waxed </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">exceeding great.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
The religion of all the four great monarchies mentioned in these
prophecies was paganism; but the paganism of ancient Babylon was reproduced
in pagan Rome, and then adapted and adopted by papal Rome.
The little horn of the eighth chapter represents Rome, both pagan and
papal, in its ecclesiastical aspect, with its union of paganism, and later of
apostate Christianity, with the secular power; with its antichristian persecutions
of the saints of God; with its perversion of the priesthood of Christ;
and with its assertion of both temporal and spiritual power over all the
world. It is evident that pagan Rome is introduced into this prophecy
chiefly as a means of locating the place and work of papal Rome, and the
ecclesiastical features of pagan Rome as typical of the same features accentuated
in papal Rome, and that the emphasis is to be placed upon the
fulfilment of the prophecy in the work of papal Rome. A careful comparison
of Dan. 7:21, 25, with Dan. 8:10-12, R. V., and 2 Thess. 2:3, 4, will
amply justify this conclusion.

service found its antitype and fulfilment. See Heb. 6:19, 20; 7:1-3, 14-16,
23-25. The action which made the Pope the vicar of God and the high
priest of the apostasy, really took away from Christ, as far as human intent
and power were concerned, his place and work as the only mediator
between God and man (1 Tim. 2:5), and this took away from Him, as far
as man could take it away, the continual mediation, according to the prediction
in this prophecy.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
The prophecies of Daniel are cumulative and widening in their view,
each carrying matters farther than the preceding one, and bringing out
more explicitly and more in detail important features down the stream of
time. In Daniel 2, under the fourth universal kingdom, the Papacy is
not represented under any direct symbol or figure at all,—simply Rome in
its united and divided state; in Daniel 7 Rome is symbolized by the </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">little
horn</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> coming up among the ten horns representing the divided state of
Rome; while in Daniel 8 the only figure used to represent the fourth world
power is the </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">little horn</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> which waxed </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">exceeding great.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
In each of these last two chapters the little horn is introduced to tell
especially of the workings of the same terrible power—Rome papal. Both
chapters deal with the same great apostasy. In the seventh chapter, the
little horn takes away </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">the law of God</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. In the eighth chapter, it takes
away </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">the gospel</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. Had it taken away only the law, this would have vitiated
the gospel; for, with the law of God gone, even the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">true</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> gospel could
not save, because the law is needed to convict and give a knowledge of
sin. And had the Papacy taken away only the gospel, and left the law,
salvation through such a system would still have been impossible, for there
is no salvation for sinners through even the law of God itself apart from
Christ and the gospel. But to make apostasy doubly sure, this power
changes, vitiates, and takes away both the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">law</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> and the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">gospel.</span></em>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
In changing the Sabbath, the Papacy struck directly at the very heart
and seal of the law of God, just as in substituting its own mediatorial system
for that of Christ's it struck directly at the heavenly sanctuary and its
service, which, in his epistle to the Hebrews, Paul shows to be the very
heart and essence of the gospel.

effect this claim of the Papacy, which finally resulted in establishing the
Pope as the head of the Roman priesthood which has usurped the priestly
work of Christ, and has established another system of mediation in its
place. This work of Clovis came to its climax in the period 503-508, and
this period therefore becomes the natural one from which to date the 1290
years of Dan. 12:11, which would accordingly end in the period 1793-98,

abundant evidence that the instruction in the ninth

</span></p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
(1) Daniel did not understand the vision concerning the treading
down of his people and the sanctuary, and therefore searched the prophecies
anew concerning the period of captivity.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
(2) He evidently made a connection between the period of seventy
years mentioned by Jeremiah and the twenty-three hundred days of the
vision, and he at once began to pray earnestly for the restoration of the
city and the sanctuary.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
(3) The angel Gabriel, who appeared to him at the first, and interpreted
all the vision with the exception of the twenty-three hundred days,
now appears, and again directs his attention to the vision.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
(4) The events of the vision begin with the kingdom of the Medes and
Persians, the era of the restoration of the Jews to their own land. In the
absence of any instruction to the contrary, this would be the natural time
in which to locate the beginning of the period of twenty-three hundred
days; and this is the very time given for the beginning of the seventy weeks,
which are clearly a part of the twenty-three hundred days, and thus determine
the time of their commencement.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
(5) The seventy weeks, or four hundred and ninety years, extend from
the restoration of literal Jerusalem and the literal temple to the preaching
of the gospel to all the world. See Acts 15:14-17. This special preaching
of the gospel was completed in one generation, and was followed by the
destruction of Jerusalem.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
(6) The twenty-three hundred prophetic days, or twenty-three hundred

the restoration of spiritual Jerusalem and of the knowledge of the mediation
of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, taken away by the little horn, after
the captivity in modern Babylon. This work of restoration is to be accomplished
in one generation by preaching the gospel to all the world (Rev.
14:6-12), and this will be followed by the destruction of the world, or fall
of all nations, of which the destruction of Jerusalem was a type.

when the decree was given to restore and build Jerusalem
(Ezra 7:11-26; Dan. 9:25), seven weeks (49 years) are measured off
to indicate the time occupied in this work of restoration. These,
however, are a part of the sixty-nine weeks (483 years) that
were to reach to Messiah, the Anointed One. Christ was anointed
in 27 </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, at His baptism. Matt. 3:13-17; Acts 10:38.
In the midst of the seventieth week (31 </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">),
Christ was crucified, or </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">cut off,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> which marked the time when the sacrifices and
oblations of the earthly sanctuary were to cease. Dan. 9:26,

to 34 </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, or to the stoning of
Stephen, and the great persecution of the church at Jerusalem which followed. Acts 7:59;
8:1. This marked the close of the seventy weeks, or 490 years, allotted to the
Jewish people.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
But the seventy weeks are a part of the 2300 days; and as
they (the seventy weeks) reach to 34 </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, the remaining
1810 years of the 2300-day period must reach to 1844, when
the work of judgment, or cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary,
was to begin. Rev. 14:6, 7. Then special light began to
shine upon the whole sanctuary subject, and Christ's mediatorial
or priestly work in it.

the taking away of the mediation of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary.
Dan. 7:25; 8:13. These two visions expose the work of modern Babylon,
the Papacy, and determine the limit of its permitted power over the people
of God, and of its perversion of the gospel of Christ in substituting another
mediatorial system for the work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
The general theme upon which the book of Daniel treats is Babylon,
both ancient and modern. Chapters 1-6, inclusive, present certain historical
facts leading up to the fall of ancient Babylon, and an attempt to
destroy the prophet Daniel himself and the final attempt to destroy the
people of God,—a brief historical outline, which is in itself a prophecy of
modern Babylon. Chapters 7-12, inclusive, contain prophecies relating
especially to modern Babylon, which supplement the historical prophecy
of the previous chapters, and which enable us to draw a very exact and
striking parallel between ancient and modern Babylon. A brief outline
of this parallel may be stated thus:—
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
(1) In the religion of ancient Babylon, image-worship found a prominent
place. The same is true of modern Babylon.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
(2) Ancient Babylon affirmed that the gods (or God) dwelt not in the
flesh. By the dogma of the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary
(that is, that she herself was born without the taint of original sin), modern
Babylon teaches that God, in the person of His Son, did not take the same
flesh with us; that is, sinful flesh.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
(3) Ancient Babylon persecuted those who refused to accept her dogmas
and worship according to her laws. Modern Babylon has done the same.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
(4) The king of ancient Babylon set himself above God, and attempted
to make his kingdom an everlasting kingdom. So does modern Babylon.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
(5) Ancient Babylon rejected the true gospel as taught to Nebuchadnezzar,
and the fall of Babylon came in consequence. Modern Babylon
has done the same in her rejection of the true gospel as brought to her in
the Reformation, and her fall is inevitable and impending.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
(6) The fall of ancient Babylon came just at the time when it was
giving expression to its contempt of all its enemies, and its confidence in its
own permanence. This experience will be repeated in the history of
modern Babylon.
</span></p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
17. What prophetic period, therefore, extends to the deliverance
of God's people from the captivity in modern Babylon,
and the restoration to them of the mediation of Christ?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And he said unto me, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Unto two thousand and three hundred
days</span></span>; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”</span> Verse 14.

sanctuary was a type of the heavenly sanctuary
(Heb. 9:23, 24; Lev. 16:29, 30, 33); the cleansing of the earthly sanctuary
was typical of the cleansing in the heavenly sanctuary; and this cleansing
of the sanctuary accomplished on the great day of atonement is the closing
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
work of Christ in His mediation for sin. And the commencement of
the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary marks the beginning of a new era
in the experience of the people of God on earth; namely, the deliverance
from the power of modern Babylon, the restoration to them of the knowledge
of the mediation of Christ for them in the heavenly sanctuary, and a
cleansing from sin in preparation for the second advent of Christ. The
cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary involves the investigative judgment,
which will be followed by the plagues, and Christ's coming. This period,
therefore, determines the time of restoration and of judgment.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">Note.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—The 1335 days
(years) of Dan. 12:12 are evidently a continuation
of the 1290 days (years) of the previous verse, which commence
with the taking away of the mediation of Christ, in
the period 503-508 </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">

The 1335 days, or years, would therefore extend to the period 1838-43,
the time of the preaching of the judgment-hour, in preparation for the
cleansing of the sanctuary, and the accompanying work at the end of the
2300 days, or years, of Dan. 8:14. At that time special blessings were to
come upon those who were delivered from the errors and bondage of Rome,
and had their minds directed anew to the mediation of Christ as the great
High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">General Note on the Prophecies of Daniel.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—The second
chapter of Daniel presents in brief outline the divine program of history leading
up to the establishment of the everlasting kingdom of God. The seventh
chapter of Daniel presents somewhat more in detail the history of those
earthly kingdoms which were to precede the establishment of the kingdom
of God, the objective point of the prophecy being the little horn and its
effort to change the laws and ordinances of God, and to destroy the subjects
of the heavenly kingdom. The period allotted to the supremacy of
this power, the Papacy (the 1260 years), is also indicated. The prophecy
of the eighth chapter of Daniel covers the period from the restoration
era in the time of the Persian kings and the establishment of the people
of God in their own land, to the restoration era just preceding the second
advent of Christ and the setting up of His everlasting kingdom. In this
chapter the leading theme is the effort of the Papacy to substitute its own
mediatorial system for the mediatorial work of Christ, and the announcement
of a prophetic period (the 2300 years), at the end of which the counterfeit
system introduced by the Papacy was to be fully exposed. The
remaining chapters of Daniel supplement the prophecies of the second,
seventh, and eighth chapters, and show that at the end of the first portion
of the 2300-year period (the 70 weeks, or 490 years) Messiah was to appear
and be cut off, following which would come the destruction of Jerusalem.
In the closing chapter two new periods are introduced (the 1290 years
and the 1335 years), at the end of which, as with the 2300 years, was to
come the movement preparatory to the setting up of God's everlasting
kingdom in the earth, in harmony with the prophecies of the second and
seventh chapters.

sin. The atonement day was virtually a day of judgment for Israel, and
the people whose sins had been atoned for were free from sin, and could
enter upon the services of the new year clean in the sight of God. This
work was kept up year after year. In the heavenly sanctuary, the sacrifice
is offered but once; and but one atonement, or cleansing of the heavenly
sanctuary, can be made, which must take place at the time assigned of
God for it. And when the great atonement, or cleansing, of the heavenly
sanctuary has been made, God's people will be forever free from sin, and
the fate of all will be forever sealed. See Rev. 22:11. This, as in the
type, will be a day of judgment.

offered there could in itself take away their sins, for it is expressly said that
it could not. Heb. 10:4. It could, however, show their </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">faith</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> in the

was intended constantly to direct their minds. The work there was a
type, or shadow, of Christ's atoning work, and, as such, carries with it a
significance that cannot be overestimated. Upon a correct understanding
of the type depends a correct understanding of the antitype. The entire
sanctuary service was an object-lesson of most important and vital gospel
truth,—that of man's salvation and the atonement of sin.

He appeals for their sins to be blotted from the books of record. As the
place of judgment is in heaven, where God's throne is, and as Christ is
present in person, it follows that the work of judgment is also in heaven.
All are judged by the record of their lives, and thus answer for the deeds
done in the body. This work will not only decide forever the cases of the
dead, but will also close the probation of all who are living, after which
Christ will come to take to Himself those who have been found loyal to Him.

phases of the judgment mentioned in the
Scriptures,—the investigative judgment, preceding the second advent;
the judgment of the lost world and wicked angels by Christ and the saints
during the one thousand years following the second advent; and the executive
judgment, or punishment of the wicked at the close of this period.
The investigative judgment takes place in heaven before Christ comes,
in order to ascertain who are worthy to be raised in the first resurrection,
at His coming, and who among the living are to be changed in the twinkling
of an eye, at the sound of the last trump. It is necessary for this to
take place before the second advent, as there will be no time for such a
work between the coming of Christ and the raising of the righteous dead.
The executive judgment on the wicked occurs after their cases have been
examined by the saints during the thousand years. Rev. 20:4, 5; 1 Cor.
6:1-3. The investigative judgment is that which is announced to the
world by the angel's message of Rev. 14:6, 7.

the world's history. John the Baptist in his preaching announced the
kingdom of heaven at hand (Matt. 3:1, 2), and prepared the way for the
first advent. John 1:22, 23. Christ Himself in His preaching of the
gospel announced the fulfilment of a definite-time prophecy (the sixty-nine
weeks, or 483 years, of Dan. 9:25), and called the people to repentance,
in view of the coming of the predicted Messiah. Mark 1:14, 15. So when
the time of the judgment comes, and Christ's second advent is near, a

to the time of the judgment, just preceding the second advent, and at its
expiration a special gospel message is sent to all the world proclaiming the
judgment-hour at hand, and calling upon all to worship the Creator. The
facts of history answer to this interpretation of the prophecy: for at this
very time (1844) just such a message was being proclaimed in various
parts of the world. This was the beginning of the great second advent
message which is now being proclaimed throughout the world.

jurisdiction, and demands submission under pains and penalties, just as

gospel truth of justification by faith, and boasts of works, just as ancient

Pontifex Maximus of the ancient pagan religions was continued in the
Pope, who is the head of the Roman priesthood, and who, in the exercise
of his priestly functions, took away the mediation of Christ, and substituted

the supremacy of the beast by yielding obedience to the law of God as

the dragon represents Satan, the great enemy and
persecutor of the church in all ages. But Satan works through principalities
and powers in his efforts to destroy the people of God. It was
through a Roman king, King Herod, that he sought to destroy Christ as
soon as He was born. Matt. 2:16. Rome must therefore be symbolized
by the dragon. The seven heads of the dragon are interpreted by some
to refer to the </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">seven hills</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> upon which the city of Rome is built; by others,
to the seven forms of government through which Rome passed; and by still
others, and more broadly, to the seven great monarchies which have oppressed
the people of God; namely, Egypt, Assyria, Chaldea, Persia, Greece,
pagan Rome, and papal Rome, in either of which Rome is represented
and included. See page </span><a href="#Pg269" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">269</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">. The ten horns, as in the fourth
beast of Daniel 7, evidently refer to the ten kingdoms into which Rome was finally
divided, and thus again identify the dragon with the Roman power.

an undisputed fact of history that under the later Roman

in 330 </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, the city
of Rome was given up to the bishop of Rome, who, from Constantine and

the fall of Rome, in 476 </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">,
the bishop of Rome became the ruling power
in Western Rome, and by decree of Justinian, March 15, 533, was declared
</span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">head of all the holy churches,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> and in a letter of the same year he was

pagan became Rome papal; the seat of pagan Rome became the seat of

the dragon was conferred upon the professed head of the church of Christ,

suppose that by the addition of certain contiguous territory with twelve

been slain during the hundreds of years covered

And if they had at death passed to their punishment, as is by some supposed,
why should the martyred ones still importune for their punishment? In
this, as in other parts of the Bible, the figure of personification is used,
in which inanimate objects are represented as alive and speaking, and
things that are not as though they were. See Judges 9:8-15; Heb. 2:11;
Rom. 4:17. These martyrs had gone down as heretics under the darkness
and superstition of the preceding seal, covered with ignominy and shame.

desolated. The earthquake happened on a holy day, when the churches

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The Great Image of Daniel 2.</span></span> This prophecy, written
over twenty-five hundred years ago, is one of the greatest, briefest,
and most comprehensive prophecies in the Bible. Under
the symbol of a great metallic image, the rise and fall of nations
is outlined till the end of time and the setting up of God's everlasting
kingdom. See reading on page <a href="#Pg204" class="tei tei-ref">204</a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The Four Beasts of Daniel 7.</span></span> This line of prophecy covers
the same ground as that of Daniel 2, but with additional features
introduced, especially that concerning the development and work
of the <span class="tei tei-q">“little horn”</span> power of the fourth beast, under which God's
people were to be oppressed until delivered and placed in possession
of the kingdom <span class="tei tei-q">“forever and ever.”</span> See reading on page
<a href="#Pg213" class="tei tei-ref">213</a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The 2300 Days of Daniel 8.</span></span> This prophecy, after tracing
the course of empire down through Medo-Persia, Greece, and
Rome, introduces the longest prophetic period in the Bible, reaching
from the beginning of the movement to restore and build
Jerusalem before Christ's first advent, to a similar work to be
performed by God's people in the last days preparatory to Christ's
second advent. See reading on page <a href="#Pg230" class="tei tei-ref">230</a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The Seventy Weeks of Daniel 9.</span></span> This prophecy fixes the
date of the beginning of the 2300 days, of which the seventy
weeks are a part; definitely marks the time of Christ's first advent;
and briefly refers to the <span class="tei tei-q">“consummation”</span> and the overthrow
of the last of earthly kingdoms. See pages <a href="#Pg232" class="tei tei-ref">232-236</a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The Standing Up of Michael—Daniel 11 and 12.</span></span> A literal
prophecy tracing the rise and fall of kings and kingdoms
from the early rulers of Persia in the sixth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, to
the overthrow of Turkey, the <span class="tei tei-q">“king of the north,”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“standing
up,”</span> or reign, of Michael, the Great Prince, which is Christ. See
page <a href="#Pg296" class="tei tei-ref">296</a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">The Prophecies of the Revelation.</span></span> These are supplemental
to the prophecies of Daniel. Under the Seven Churches,
the Seven Seals, the Seven Trumpets, the Great Red Dragon,
the Leopard Beast, and the Two-Horned Beast, the history and
experience of the church and of earthly kingdoms are traced during
the Christian era, to the end of the age. See pages <a href="#Pg301" class="tei tei-ref">301-310</a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Christ's Great Prophecy.</span></span> Christ's claim to being a prophet,
and the greatest of all prophets, is fully established by His prophecy
recorded in Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 21. In this He
depicts minutely the destruction of Jerusalem, the great tribulation
of the Dark Ages, and the signs that were to herald His
second coming. See pages <a href="#Pg311" class="tei tei-ref">311-325</a>.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. As He was about to leave the temple, what did He say?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, your house is left unto you <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">desolate</span></span>.”</span> Verse 38.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">Note.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—That which
was to fill up their cup of iniquity was their
final rejection and crucifixion of Christ, and their condemnation and persecution

5. Hearing these words, what questions did the disciples ask?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the

</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">Note.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—Christ's
answers to these questions are worthy of the most
careful study. The destruction of Jerusalem and the overthrow of the
Jewish nation attending it are a type of the final destruction of all the cities
of the world, and the overthrow of all nations. To some extent, therefore,
the descriptions of the two great events seem to be blended. When
Christ referred to the destruction of Jerusalem, His prophetic words reached
beyond that event to the final conflagration when the Lord shall rise out
of His place </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> and

Isa. 26:21. Thus the entire discourse was given not for the early disciples
only, but for those who were to live during the closing scenes of the
world's history. During the discourse Christ did, however, give definite
signs, both of the destruction of Jerusalem and of His second coming.
</span></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. In His reply, how did Christ indicate that neither the end
of the world nor of the Jewish nation was immediately at hand?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Take heed that no man

Christ; and shall deceive many. And ye shall hear of wars and
rumors of wars: see that ye be not troubled: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">for all these things
must come to pass, but the end is not yet</span></span>.”</span> Verses 4-6.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. What did He say of the wars, famines, pestilences, and
earthquakes which were to precede these events?

precede and culminate in the great calamity
and overthrow, first, of Jerusalem, and finally of the whole world; for, as
already noted, the prophecy has a double application, first, to Jerusalem
and the Jewish nation, and secondly, to the whole world; the destruction of
Jerusalem for its rejection of Christ at His first advent being a type of the
destruction of the world at the end for its rejection of Christ in refusing to
heed the closing warning message sent by God to prepare the world for
Christ's second advent.
</span></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. In what language did Christ briefly describe the experiences

Thus it was respecting the end of the Jewish nation; and thus it will be
in the end of the world as a whole. When the gospel, or good news, of
Christ's coming kingdom has been preached in all the world for a witness
unto all nations, the end of the world—of all nations—will come. As
the end of the Jewish nation came with overwhelming destruction, so will
come the end of the world. Armageddon, the battle of the nations, will be
fought, and the world will be swept with the besom of destruction under
the seven last plagues. See readings on pages </span><a href="#Pg206" class="tei tei-ref"><span style="font-size: 90%">296</span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">,

66 </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, when Cestius came against the city,
but for some unaccountable reason suddenly withdrew his army from it,
the Christians discerned in this the sign foretold by Christ, and fled. After
the departure of Cestius, Josephus, in his </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Wars of the Jews,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> chapter 20,

city, as from a ship when it is going to sink.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> It is a remarkable fact that
in the terrible siege which occurred under Titus three and one-half years
later, not a single Christian is known to have lost his life, while 1,100,000
Jews are said to have perished in it. Here is a most striking lesson on the
value and importance of studying and believing the prophecies, and giving
heed to the signs of the times. Those who believed what Christ had said,
and watched for the sign which He had foretold, were saved, while the unbelieving
perished. So it will be in the end of the world. The watchful
and believing will be delivered, while the careless and unbelieving will be
snared and taken. See Matt. 24:36-44; Luke 21:34-36; 1 Thess. 5:1-6.

would be an unfavorable time in which to flee,
entailing discomfort and hardship; and an attempt to flee on the Sabbath
day would doubtless have been met with difficulty, so false and pharisaical
were the notions of the Jews respecting the true character and object of
the Sabbath. See Matt. 12:1-14; Luke 13:14-17; Mark 1:32; 2:23-28;
John 5:10-18.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
The prayers of Christ's followers were heard. Events were so over-*ruled
that neither Jews nor Romans hindered the flight of the Christians.
Upon the retreat of Cestius, the Jews pursued after his army, and the
Christians thus had an opportunity to leave the city. The country also
had been cleared of enemies who might have endeavored to intercept them.
At the time of this siege, the Jews were assembled at Jerusalem to keep
the Feast of Tabernacles, and thus the Christians of Judea were able to
escape unmolested, and in the autumn, a most favorable time for flight.

Following the destruction of Jerusalem came the persecution of the

</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, and continuing
for ten years (Rev. 2:10), being the most bitter and extensive
persecution of God's people the world had yet witnessed. Following this
came the still greater and more terrible persecution of the saints during
the long centuries of papal supremacy, foretold in Dan. 7:25 and Rev.
12:6. All these tribulations occurred under either pagan or papal Rome.

glorious meteoric shower of November, 1833, when the display was so
much superior to any artistic display of fireworks that neither language nor
any element in nature can furnish comparisons. The comparison of the
sheet-iron thunder of the theaters to the electric display of Providence
when the heavens are all on fire, and the earth trembles, would be tolerable.
But the awful grandeur of the display on the night of the thirteenth of
November, 1833, which made the stoutest heart stand in awe, and the
most defiant infidel quake with fear, is never to be compared with the most
brilliant fireworks. Those who witnessed the meteoric shower named saw
the greatest display that man ever will see until the day that Peter speaks
of when the heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements shall
melt with fervent heat. The agricultural editor of the </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Register</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">

these have gone forth to the world hundreds of millions of copies of the
Bible, and countless pages of tracts and pamphlets, disseminating knowledge
upon the truths of salvation. Besides these, millions of copies of

Up to that point the book of Daniel, as a whole, was to be closed up; in

It is a singular and striking fact that immediately following the overthrow
of the papal power in 1798, Bible societies, tract societies, and Sunday-schools
sprang up in large numbers. The London Religious Tract
Society was organized in 1799, the British and Foreign Bible Society in
1804, the American Bible Society in 1816, and the American Tract Society
in 1825. The Bible has now been translated into about four hundred and
fifty languages and dialects, and sent to every part of the globe. Before
that time access to the Bible was confined to comparatively few. Now the
humblest person may possess it, and is as free to read and study it as is
the most exalted in the land. A little more than one hundred years ago
there was not a Sunday-school in the world, the first one being organized
by Robert Raikes, at Gloucester, England, in 1784. Now there are more
than 285,000 such schools, with over 28,000,000 officers, teachers, and
pupils.

These have been remarkable, phenomenal, and without

and a quarter ago knew nothing of steamships, steam and
electric railways, telegraphs, telephones, photographs, phonographs,
sewing-machines, anesthetics, submarine cables, linotypes,
monotypes, motion pictures, X-rays, aeroplanes, or
wireless telegraphy. Were they to be raised from the dead,
they would be as much astonished at all these things as would

It will be noticed that none of these inventions antedate 1798. Go
back a little over a century and we find the world about where it was in
the days of the patriarchs. For thousands of years there seemed to be
scarcely any advancement or improvement in knowledge. But suddenly
with the opening of the nineteenth century, the world awoke from its long
sleep, and a new era dawned,—the time of the end, when knowledge was
to be increased.

my mind this precious doctrine—for such I must call
it—of the return of the Lord to this earth is taught in the New Testament
as clearly as any other doctrine in it; yet I was in the church fifteen or sixteen
years before I ever heard a sermon on it. There is hardly any church
that does not make a great deal of baptism; but in all of Paul's epistles I
believe baptism is spoken of only thirteen times, while it speaks about the
return of our Lord fifty times; and yet the church has had very little to say
about it. Now I can see a reason for this. The devil does not want us
to see this truth; for nothing would wake up the church so much. The
moment a man takes hold of the truth that Jesus Christ is coming back
again to receive His followers to Himself, this world loses its hold on him.
Gas stocks, and water stocks, and stocks in banks and railroads are of very
much less consequence to him then. His heart is free, and he looks for the
blessed appearing of his Lord, who, at His coming, will take him into His
blessed kingdom.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">The

to ask, namely, perfect obedience, and exacted of the transgressor only
what it ought to exact, namely, death as the penalty for sin,—death under

object and secret of the old covenant is revealed
here. The people did not realize the weakness and sinfulness of their
own hearts, or their need of divine grace and help to keep the law; and so,
in their ignorance, they readily pledged obedience to it. But almost
immediately they began to commit idolatry, and thus to break the law of
God, or the very conditions laid down as their part of the covenant. In
themselves the conditions were good; but in their own strength the people
were unable to fulfil them. The great object of the old covenant therefore
was to teach the people their weakness, and their inability to keep the law
without the help of God. Like the law itself, over which the old covenant
was made, this covenant was designed to shut them up to the provisions
of the new or everlasting covenant, and lead them to Christ. Gal. 3:23,

24. And the lesson which Israel as a nation had to learn in this, each
individual now must learn before he can be saved. There is no salvation
for any one while trusting in self. Unaided, no one can keep the law.
Only in Christ is there either remission of sins or power to keep from sinning.
The breaking of the tables of the law signified that the terms of the
covenant had been broken; the renewing of the tables (Ex. 34:1, 28), God's
patience and long-suffering with His people.

While the covenant made at
Sinai is called the first covenant, it is by no means the first covenant that God
ever made with man. Long before this He made a covenant with Abraham;
He also made a covenant with Noah, and with Adam. Neither must
it be supposed that the first or old covenant existed for a time as the </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">only</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
covenant with mankind, and that this must serve its purpose and pass
away before any one could share in the promised blessings of the second
or new covenant. Had this been the case, then during that time there
would have been no pardon for any one. What is called the new or second
covenant virtually existed before the covenant made at Sinai; for the
covenant with Abraham was confirmed in Christ (Gal. 3:17), and it is
only through Christ that there is any value to the new or second covenant.
There is no blessing that can be gained by virtue of the new covenant that
was not promised to Abraham. And we, with whom the new covenant is
made, can share the inheritance which it promises only by being children
of Abraham, and sharing in his blessing. Gal. 3:7, 9. And since no one
can have anything except as a child of Abraham, it follows that there
is nothing in what is called the new or second covenant that was not in the
covenant made with Abraham. The second covenant existed in every
essential feature, except its ratification, long before the first, even from the
days of Adam. It is called second because its ratification occurred after
the covenant made and ratified at Sinai.

that what Christ took away was ceremonialism as expressed in the

giving Himself to do the will of God, was the experience of doing the will of

the new covenant promise is fulfilled that the law shall be written in the

righteousness which is witnessed by the law, and revealed in the life in

restoring the law to its place in the heart and life of the one who believes
on Christ, and accepts His mediatorial work. Such faith, instead of
making void the law, establishes it in the heart of the believer. The gospel
is not against the law, therefore, but upholds, maintains, and presents the
law to us in Christ.

Their deliverance
from bondage was in order that they might keep God's law (Ps. 105:43-45),
and particularly the Sabbath, the great seal, sign, and memorial-institution
of the law. The recollection of their bondage and oppressed condition
in Egypt was to be an additional incentive for keeping the Sabbath in the
land of freedom. The Sabbath, therefore, besides being a memorial of
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page420">[pg 420]</span><a name="Pg420" id="Pg420" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
creation, was to be to them a memorial of their deliverance from bondage,
and of the great power of God as manifested in this deliverance. And as
Egypt stands as a symbol of the condition of every one in the world under
the slavery of sin, so the Sabbath is to be kept by every saved soul as a
memorial of the deliverance from this slavery by the mighty power of God
through Christ.

a work of redemption,—of making holy
sinful or unholy beings. Like the work of creation itself, this requires
creative power. See Ps. 51:10; John 3:3, 6; Eph. 2:10. And as the
Sabbath is the appropriate sign or memorial of the creative power of God
wherever displayed, whether in creation, deliverance from human bondage,
or deliverance from the slavery of sin, it is to be kept as a sign of the work
of sanctification. This will be one great reason for the saints' keeping it
throughout eternity. It will remind them not only of their own creation

sanctify is to make holy, or to set apart for a holy use.

thus of what Christ is to the believer, because it is a reminder of the creative
power of God as manifested in the work of regeneration. It is the sign
of the power of God, therefore, in both creation and redemption. To the
believer, it is the evidence, or sign, that he knows the true God, who,
through Christ, created all things, and who, through Christ, redeems the
sinner and makes him whole.

bondage the Israelites had to some extent lost the
knowledge of God, and departed from His precepts. The Sabbath came
to be greatly disregarded by them; and in consequence of the oppression
of the Pharaohs, especially the Pharaoh of the exodus, as witnessed by
the rigorous exactions made upon them by this latter king through their
taskmasters, its observance was made apparently impossible. See Ex.
5:1-19. The special point, both of reform and of conflict, just preceding
their deliverance from bondage, was over the matter of Sabbath observance.
Moses and Aaron had shown them that obedience to God was the first condition
of deliverance. Their efforts to restore the observance of the Sabbath
among the Israelites had come to the notice of Pharaoh; hence his
accusation against them, </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">let</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> [hinder]

was indeed, therefore, an additional and special reason for their keeping
the Sabbath. But Egypt and Egyptian bondage simply represent sin and
the bondage of sin. See Rev. 11:8; Hosea 11:1; Matt. 2:15; Zech. 10:10.
Every one, therefore, who has been delivered from sin has the same
reason for keeping the Sabbath as had the Israelites who were released from
Egyptian bondage.

While under the fall the Sabbath, therefore, may bring physical

promotive of the knowledge and fear of God, must of necessity be a deterrent

His life and teachings put the Sabbath back in its proper place and setting,
as a day of worship and beneficence, a day for doing acts of charity and
mercy, as well as engaging in contemplation of God and in acts of devotion.
Thus He magnified it and made it honorable. One of the most prominent

He did rescue it from the rubbish of tradition, the false ideas, and the superstitions
with which it had been buried, and by which it had been degraded and
turned aside from the channel of blessing and practical service to man
designed by its Maker. The Pharisees had placed the institution </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">above</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
man, and </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">against</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> man. Christ reversed the order, and said, </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The Sabbath

Antioch, we have a record of eighty-four Sabbaths on which the apostle
held religious services, while, so far as the record shows, he held only one

beginning to end, the Bible recognizes but one weekly
Sabbath,—the day upon which God rested in the beginning; which was
made known to Israel at Sinai (Neh. 9:13, 14); was observed by Christ
and His apostles; and is to be kept by the redeemed in the world to come.
Isa. 66:22, 23.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
The terms Sabbath, Sabbaths, and Sabbath days occur sixty times in
the New Testament, and in every case but one refer to the seventh day.
In Col. 2:16, 17, reference is made to the annual sabbaths connected with
the three annual feasts observed by Israel before the first advent of Christ.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
The first day of the week is mentioned but eight times in the New
Testament, six of which are found in the four Gospels, and refer to the day
on which Christ arose from the dead. See Matt. 28:1; Mark 16:2, 9;
Luke 24:1; John 20:1, 19. The other two (Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 16:2) refer
to the only religious meeting held on the first day of the week after the
ascension, in apostolic times, recorded in the New Testament, and to a
systematic accounting and laying by in store at home on that day for the
poor saints in Judea and Jerusalem.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
It is evident, therefore, that the Sabbath of the New Testament is the
same as the Sabbath of the Old Testament, and that there is nothing in the
New Testament setting aside the seventh-day Sabbath, and putting the
first day of the week in its place.

day of the week in all the Bible is claimed by God
as His day. During the second, third, and fourth centuries of the Christian
era, when apostasy came in like a flood, men, without any warrant
or command of Scripture, thinking to do honor to Christ and despite
to the Jews who crucified Christ, began to neglect the Sabbath of the
fourth commandment, and to honor the day of the week on which Christ
rose from the dead, the first day, as </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">the Lord's day,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> until finally the
Sabbath was almost wholly lost sight of, and the Sunday quite generally
took its place. But there was no more warrant for this change in the divine
and unchangeable law of God than there was for other errors and changes
which crept into the professed Christian church during this same time, such
as abstaining from meat on Friday in honor of the crucifixion; Mariolatry,
or the worship of the Virgin Mary; the mass; purgatory; indulgences;
prayers for the dead; saint-worship; and the human vicarship of Christ.
There was no more divine authority for one than for the others. All came
in through apostasy. The Bible knows but one true and living God, one
Lawgiver, one Mediator between God and man, one Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, one body, one Spirit, one hope, one faith, one baptism, and

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">Note.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—Israel's
Babylonish captivity, under Nebuchadnezzar and
his sons, was seventy years long because that for 420 years, or for six times
seventy years,—from the days of Solomon to Nebuchadnezzar's time,—they
had largely neglected to keep the Sabbath. See Eze. 22:8, 26; Jer.
25:8-11; 17:24, 27; 2 Chron. 36:15-21. The seventy years' desolation
made up for the 420 years of Sabbath desecration. So during the millennium,
or the one thousand years after Christ's second advent, the whole
earth will lie desolate, or keep sabbath, for one thousand years, because
that for six thousand years the world's inhabitants have disregarded the
Sabbath. See this period and condition pointed out in Rev. 20:1-4; Isa.
24:1-6; Jer. 4:23-27. The periods of rest and desolation of the land are
divinely appointed sabbatical compensations for man's irreligion, as manifested
in Sabbath desecration. They are impressive lessons on the importance
of keeping the seventh-day Sabbath, and the results of breaking
and disregarding it.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">Notes.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—Untempered mortar
is that which is improperly worked,
and will not therefore hold together or stand the test. Thus it is with the
reasons advanced for keeping Sunday instead of the Bible Sabbath, the
seventh day. They are not only unsound and untenable in themselves,
but are utterly inconsistent, contradictory, and destructive one of the
other, among themselves. They are like the witnesses employed by the
Jewish leaders to condemn Christ. Of these the record says: </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The chief
priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put Him to
death; and found none. For many bare </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">false witness</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> against Him, but
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">their witness agreed not together</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> Mark 14:55, 56. The lack of
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">agreement</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> among them was evidence in itself of the
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">falsity</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> of their testimony.
In nothing, perhaps, is a lack of agreement better illustrated than in the
reasons assigned for Sunday-keeping. Note the following:—
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
One says the Sabbath has been </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">changed</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> from the seventh to the first
day of the week.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Another says that the Sabbath commandment requires only one day
of rest after six of labor, and hence </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">there has been no change</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Some reason that all ought to keep Sunday, because although, as they
affirm, God did not appoint a </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">particular</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> day, yet </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">agreement</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">
is necessary; and to have any or every day a sabbath would be equal to no sabbath at all.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Others, to avoid the claims of God's law, assert that the Sabbath
precept is one of those ordinances which was </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">against us, contrary to us,
blotted out, and nailed to the cross</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. Still, they admit that a day of rest and
convocation is necessary, and therefore the day of Christ's resurrection,
they say, has been chosen.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Another class say they believe it is impossible to know which is the
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">seventh day</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, although they have no difficulty in ascertaining which is the
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">first</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Some are so bold even as to declare that </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Sunday is the original seventh
day</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Others, with equal certainty, say that those who keep the seventh
day are endeavoring to be </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">justified by the law</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, and are
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">fallen from grace</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Another class, with more liberal views, say they believe that every one
should be fully persuaded in his own mind, whether he keep this day, or
that, or none at all.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Still again, as if having found the great desideratum or missing link
in the argument, men credited with even more than ordinary intelligence,
will sometimes declare that it is </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">impossible to keep the seventh day on a round
and rolling earth</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">; and yet, strange to say, they find no difficulty in keeping
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Sunday anywhere</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, and believe that this day
should be observed </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">the world
over</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">!
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Lastly, and more terrible and presumptuous than all the rest, some,
like Herod of old in slaying all the children of Bethlehem in order to make
sure of killing Christ, have gone so far as to teach that </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">all ten commandments
have been abolished</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, in order to avoid the duty enjoined in the
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">fourth</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. But as in the case of Herod, God's Anointed escaped the murderous
blow of this wicked king, so in the judgment such will have to meet God over
His broken law, and will find that the Sabbath precept stands there unchanged
with the rest.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Said Christ, </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,
and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom
of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be
called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> Matt. 5:19.

others. On this day especially He went about doing good, ministering to
the sick, and bringing relief to those long bound by Satan. Luke 13:15,
16; John 5:5, 6. And as He is our pattern in all things, we, too, like
Him, should seek to make the Sabbath a day for helping and blessing
others. To loose the bands of wickedness, undo the heavy burdens, deal
bread to the hungry, clothe the naked, and let the oppressed go free, is
the fast which God has chosen, and the Sabbath-keeping most acceptable
to Him. Isa. 58:1-12. In this kind of work and ministry there is
room for a world-wide Sabbath reform.

John Wesley gave the following Christian advice: </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Condemn no man
for not thinking as you think. Let every one enjoy the full and free liberty
of thinking for himself. Let every man use his own judgment, since every
man must give an account of himself to God. Abhor every approach, in
any kind or degree, to the spirit of persecution. If you cannot reason nor
persuade a man into the truth, never attempt to force a man into it. If
love will not compel him to come, leave him to God, the Judge of all.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

To them, consciousness, our only means of measuring time, is gone; and it
will seem to them when they awake that absolutely no time has elapsed.
And herein lies a most comforting thought in the Bible doctrine of the sleep
of the dead, that in death there is no consciousness of the passing of time.
To those who sleep in Jesus, their sleep, whether long or short, whether
one year, one thousand years, or six thousand years, will be but as if the
moment of sad parting were followed instantly by the glad reunion in the
presence of Jesus at His glorious appearing and the resurrection of the just.

It ought also to be a comforting thought to those whose lives have

Again, it would mar the felicity of one's enjoyment in heaven could
he look upon earth and see his friends and relatives suffering from persecution,
want, cold, or hunger, or sorrowing for the dead. God's way is best,—that
all sentient life, animation, activity, thought, and consciousness
should cease at death, and that all should wait till the resurrection for
their future life and eternal reward. See Heb. 11:39, 40.

firmly bound together with clasps of iron, with this inscription placed on

no doubt, that a birch-tree seed was buried with the princess. Soon it
began to sprout. Its tiny shoot, soft and pliable at first, found its way up
through the ponderous stones of the massive masonry. Slowly and imperceptibly,
but with irresistible power, it grew, until at last it burst the
bands of iron asunder, and opened this never-to-be-opened grave, leaving

They will themselves have lost their opportunity to obtain eternal life;

themselves unworthy of it. Their destruction will, in fact, be an act of
love and mercy on the part of God; for to perpetuate their lives would only
be to perpetuate sin, sorrow, suffering, and misery. Terrible, therefore,
as this judgment will be, there will, in consequence of it, be nothing of

have nothing whatever to do with them. They are from beneath, and not
from above. However promising or pleasing they may be at first, they are
downward and destructive in their tendency, and ultimately lead away from

is important to settle a plain question of duty at once,

do as did Balaam—ask God again concerning that which He has plainly
and expressly spoken—is dangerous. Nor should we, like the unbelieving
Jews, seek a sign from heaven to convince us that we ought to obey the
written Word. Has God spoken? Is it His word? Then obey. Do not
insult Heaven with the question whether it is right to obey. If one gets
an answer to such prayers, it will more than likely be a permission to
have one's own chosen way of continuing in disobedience, the end of which
is death. See 1 Kings 22:1-36; Eze. 14:1-5.

more earnestly one desires to know the will of God,

him. If light is sown for the righteous, such are the very ones who may

reason why the Lord favored Cornelius with a visit

perfectly, but because the Lord saw in him a sincere desire for more
light, and a willing mind to comply with every known requirement. That
spirit was pleasing to God, and He therefore opened the way for Cornelius
to learn the whole truth from Peter, that he might be saved. God never
changes. He does the same now with sincere, devoted persons. All may
now receive advanced light, if, like Cornelius, they seek it, and are willing
to walk in it when it comes to them. If it is neglected, they are guilty
before God, and will be left to the buffetings of the enemy.

those who have just come to trust in His grace—especially need
to guard. The first ... is that of looking to their own works, trusting
to anything they can do, to bring themselves into harmony with God.
He who is trying to become holy by his own works in keeping the law, is
attempting an impossibility. All that man can do without Christ is
polluted with selfishness and sin. It is the grace of Christ alone, through
faith, that can make us holy. The opposite and no less dangerous error
is that belief in Christ releases men from keeping the law of God; that
since by faith alone we become partakers of the grace of Christ, our works
have nothing to do with our redemption.... Obedience—the
service and allegiance of love—is the true sign of discipleship....
Instead of releasing man from obedience, it is faith, and faith only, that
makes us partakers of the grace of Christ, which enables us to render
obedience. We do not earn salvation by our obedience; for salvation is
the free gift of God, to be received by faith. But obedience is the fruit
of faith.... That so-called faith in Christ which professes to release
men from the obligation of obedience to God, is not faith, but
presumption.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Steps

No one can consistently hope for that which God has not promised. To
expect that God will do that which He has never promised to do is only
presumption. Faith is distinct from presumption. To have abiding
confidence in the promise of God is faith; but presumption may rest entirely
on feeling or desire. Feeling cannot therefore be relied on in the
matter of faith. Faith is a pure belief, a confiding trust, in the promises
of God, irrespective of feeling. This perfect trust enables one to surmount
difficulties under the most trying circumstances, even when the feelings
are depressed or well-nigh crushed.

a joy. They always find the dark side of everything, if there is a dark
side to be found. They appear to be conscientious grumblers, as if it were
their duty to extract some essence of misery from every circumstance....
On the other hand, there are rare spirits who always take cheerful
views of life. They look at the bright side. They find some joy and
beauty everywhere.... In the most faulty picture they see some
bit of beauty which charms them. In the most disagreeable person they
discover some kindly trait or some bud of promise. In the most disheartening
circumstances they find something for which to be thankful, some gleam
of cheer breaking through the thick gloom.... When a ray of sunlight
streamed through a crack in the shutter and made a bright patch on
the floor in the darkened room, the little dog rose from his dark corner and
went and lay down in the one sunny spot; and these people live in the same
philosophical way. If there is one beam of cheer or hope anywhere in
their lot, they will find it.... We have no right to project the gloom
of our discontent over any other life. Our ministry is to be ever toward
joy. There is nothing so depressing in its effects upon others as morbidness....

We trespass one against another. These offenses, while involving sin,
are called faults, and should be corrected by confession and forgiveness.
The only remedy for either pointed out in the Word of God is heartfelt
confession. One writer aptly says: </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Confess your sins to God, who only
can forgive them, and your faults to one another. If you have given offense
to your friend or neighbor, you are to acknowledge your wrong, and it is
his duty freely to forgive you. Then you are to seek the forgiveness of
God, because the brother you have wounded is the property of God, and
in injuring him you sinned against his Creator and Redeemer.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

To confess one's faults is not an easy thing to do; in fact, it is one of

that of sorrow and true repentance. It has been said that the four hardest

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">

this fact leads many to treat the house

divine worship than that a sense of awe and silence should pervade the
place of worship, and that only the sound of prayer, praise, and thanksgiving
to God should be heard within its walls. Both upon entering and
just before leaving the house of God it is highly appropriate and a most
excellent practise for each worshiper to bow the head for a few moments
in silent prayer.

taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be
called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it
a den of thieves.”</span> Mark 11:15-17.

the two cleansings of the temple by Christ at the
beginning and close of His ministry (John 2:13-17; Matt. 21:12-16),
shows that God is particular in regard to the worship and conduct of the
worshipers in His house. No performance or exercise should be permitted
in any church or building especially dedicated to God's service which is
not in keeping with its sacred character, or conducive to reverence for God
and for holy things. It should not be made a place for feasting, visiting,
or worldly entertainment and amusement.

poetry and flowers, is elevating and refining in
its nature, and should therefore have its place in the worship of God, and
in the life and experience of God's people. It is adapted to every mood and
feeling of the human soul, and many times has reached hearts when other
means have failed. Next to prayer, music seems best adapted to worship.

the uses and benefits of music and song. Music is often perverted to
serve purposes of evil, and it thus becomes one of the most alluring agencies
of temptation. But, rightly employed, it is a precious gift of God,
designed to uplift the thoughts to high and noble themes, to inspire and
elevate the soul. As the children of Israel, journeying through the wilderness,
cheered their way by the music of sacred song, so God bids His children
today gladden their pilgrim life. There are few means more effective
for fixing His words in the memory than repeating them in song. And
such song has wonderful power. It has power to subdue rude and uncultivated
natures; power to quicken thought and to awaken sympathy, to
promote harmony of action, and to banish the gloom and foreboding that
destroy courage and weaken effort.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Education,</span><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">

womanhood with the will undisciplined and the passions uncontrolled, will
generally in after-life pursue a course which God condemns. The neglect
of parents to properly discipline their children has been a fruitful source
of evil in many families. The youth have not been restrained as they
should have been. Parents have neglected to follow the directions of the
Word of God in this matter, and the children have taken the reins of government
into their own hands. The consequence has been that they have
generally succeeded in ruling their parents, instead of being under their
authority. False ideas and a foolish, misdirected affection have nurtured
traits which have made the children unlovely and unhappy, have embittered
the lives of the parents, and have extended their baleful influence
from generation to generation. Any child that is permitted to have his
own way will dishonor God and bring his father and mother to shame.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

should never be given in anger, for anger in the
parent stirs up anger in the child. It is well to pray with a child before
correcting him, and frequently mild but faithful instruction, admonition,
and prayer are all the training necessary,—are, in fact, the best training
that can be given. But in any case of perverseness, stubbornness, or wilful
disobedience, the correction, whatever it may be, should be persisted
in until the child yields submissively to the will and wishes of the parent.
It is best, generally, that correction should be done in private, as this tends
to preserve the self-respect of the child, a very important element in character
building. No correction nor training should be violent or abusive,
or given for the purpose of breaking the will of the child, but rather to
direct the will, bring it into proper subjection, and the child to a realizing
sense of what is right and duty.

Tobacco using is demoralizing in its general effects, and tends to
create an appetite for strong drink. It originated with the natives of
North America, the Indians. In November, 1492, when Columbus
discovered the island of Cuba, he sent two sailors to explore it, who,
when they returned, reported, among many other strange and curious
discoveries, that the natives carried with them lighted firebrands, and
puffed smoke from their mouths and noses, which they supposed to be
the way the savages had of perfuming themselves. They afterward
declared that they </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">saw the naked savages twist large leaves together,
and smoke like devils.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> Originating with the wild barbarians of America,
the smoking habit, after some years, was introduced into Europe, and
was rapidly adopted, not only by the lower classes, but by those in high
authority, even princes and nobles participating in the new intoxication.
It has since become well-nigh universal.

all the walks and relationships of life, whether in the
home, the medical profession, the pulpit, or the legislative assembly,
men should stand for temperance. To license the liquor traffic is to
legalize and foster it. It cannot exist nor thrive without the patronage
of each rising generation, a large number of whom it must necessarily
ruin, body, soul, and spirit. For the state to receive money from such
a source, therefore, must be highly reprehensible. The practise has fittingly
been likened to a father catching sharks, and baiting his hook with
his own children.

"We wrestle ... against the rulers of the
darkness of this world." Eph. 6:12.</div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In these three beautiful pictures illustrating the game of
life, Satan, the prince of darkness, is represented as playing
with man for his soul.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The scene chosen is a wide vault, whose arch is embellished
with lizard-shaped monsters, which adhere closely to the two
pillars, down which they seem to creep. On the left-hand side
of the picture, near Satan, is an open-mouthed lion ready to
devour his victim at the first opportunity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The upper surface of a sarcophagus is transformed into a
chess-board, beside which man sits, his head resting on his
hand, and his countenance full of careful thought as to what
moves he should make next.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Opposite him is Satan, seated, his chin resting on his hand,
his hair and beard bristling wildly, and every feature expressive
of cunning intent, and a determination to watch every move,
take advantage of every mistake, and win if possible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beneath the arch, in the background, stands a lovely angel
form unnoticed by either of the players, but watching intently
the progress of the game.

"What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole
world, and lose his own soul?" Mark 8:36.</div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here we see the results of the game lost. Satan has been
victorious. With a wild and horrid leer and a deathlike grip
he has seized his victim, and in triumph points to the sure but
gruesome signs of death,—the skulls and cross-bones. Amidst
smoke and flame, the hand of Death rises to strike man with
his poisoned dart.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In sadness and despair man sits, with covered face, and
weeps over his defeat. His hope is gone; he knows no peace;
he feels the icy clasp of his conquering foe. With keen regret,
he now ponders over his loss of faith, his neglect of prayer, and
his failure to study and follow his Guide-book. Life, with its
opportunities for gaining the life to come, has been wasted; and
now, when too late to make amends, he sees his fatal moves and
his great mistakes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The figures on the wall have changed their visage, and seem
ready to pounce upon the doomed and helpless man. The
lion also has become more fierce, and thirsts for his blood, while
the angel turns in sadness from the scene and weeps.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The entire view is one of inexpressible sorrow and regret.

In the closing scene of this allegorical representation of man's
conflict with the powers of darkness, we have pictured the
happy issue of a faithful Christian life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Satan has been defeated, and has departed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sleeping lion, the open Word, the cross and crown, all
speak of victory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Instead of sitting in sorrow and mourning over defeat, the
man, with cheerful looks and thankful heart, lifts his eyes toward
heaven, and rejoices that he has met and vanquished his
deadly foe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the place of the ugly monsters on the wall, cherubs are
seen, with laurel wreaths ready to place upon the victor's brow,
while the angel, with joyful satisfaction, points the victor to his
exceeding great reward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is the game which all, whether conscious of the fact
or not, are playing. What its outcome will be in each case
depends upon how each one meets and fights life's battle day
by day. All may be victors if they will.
